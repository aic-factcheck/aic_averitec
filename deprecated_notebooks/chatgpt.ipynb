      "A: Yes\n",
      "\n",
      "Q: What is an example of how the UK Job Support Scheme works?\n",
      "A: The Government example is:\n",
      "\n",
      "Beth normally works 5 days a week and earns ¬£350 a week. Her Company is suffering with reduced sales due to Coronavirus. Rather than making Beth redundant, the company puts Beth on the Job Support Scheme, working 2 days a week (40% of her usual hours).\n",
      "Her employer pays Beth ¬£140 for the days she works.\n",
      "And for the time she is not working (3 days or 60%, worth ¬£210), she will also earn2/3, or ¬£140, bringing her total earnings to ¬£280, 80% of her normal wage.\n",
      "The Government will give a grant worth ¬£70 (1/3 of hours not worked, equivalent to 20% of her normal wages) to Beth‚Äôs employer to support them in keeping Beth‚Äôs job.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q: What are the requirements for making a claim?\n",
      "A: In order to make the claim, the employee must work at least 33% of their usual hours for the job to be seen as ‚Äòviable‚Äô and therefore eligible under this scheme. The Government will then pay a third of the hours not worked (up to a cap), with the employer also contributing a third. The remaining unpaid third is effectively the employee‚Äôs contribution to the scheme. This means that an employee earns 77% of their normal wage where the Government contribution has not been capped.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q: Is the UK Job Support Scheme as generous as the furlough scheme?\n",
      "A: This scheme is by no means as generous as the previous ‚Äòfurlough‚Äô scheme and until further guidance is announced it is unclear whether it will be of any tangible benefit to company directors (who may typically be paid a modest PAYE salary, at the National Insurance earnings threshold).\n",

      "Q: What Caused Most Deaths in 1918 Spanish Flu  Influenza/Pandemic ?\n",
      "A: The majority of deaths during the influenza pandemic of 1918-1919 were not caused by the influenza virus acting alone, report researchers from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health. Instead, most victims succumbed to bacterial pneumonia following influenza virus infection. The pneumonia was caused when bacteria that normally inhabit the nose and throat invaded the lungs along a pathway created when the virus destroyed the cells that line the bronchial tubes and lungs.\n",
      "\n",
      "A future influenza pandemic may unfold in a similar manner, say the NIAID authors, whose paper in the Oct. 1 issue of The Journal of Infectious Diseases is now available online. Therefore, the authors conclude, comprehensive pandemic preparations should include not only efforts to produce new or improved influenza vaccines and antiviral drugs but also provisions to stockpile antibiotics and bacterial vaccines as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "The work presents complementary lines of evidence from the fields of pathology and history of medicine to support this conclusion. \"The weight of evidence we examined from both historical and modern analyses of the 1918 influenza pandemic favors a scenario in which viral damage followed by bacterial pneumonia led to the vast majority of deaths,\" says co-author NIAID Director Anthony S. Fauci, M.D. \"In essence, the virus landed the first blow while bacteria delivered the knockout punch.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "NIAID co-author and pathologist Jeffery Taubenberger, M.D., Ph.D., examined lung tissue samples from 58 soldiers who died of influenza at various U. S. military bases in 1918 and 1919. The samples, preserved in paraffin blocks, were re-cut and stained to allow microscopic evaluation. Examination revealed a spectrum of tissue damage \"ranging from changes characteristic of the primary viral pneumonia and evidence of tissue repair to evidence of severe, acute, secondary bacterial pneumonia,\" says Dr. Taubenberger. In most cases, he adds\n",
      "\n",
      "Q: Did Dr Anthony Fauci publication blame masks for 1918-19 flu deaths ?\n",
      "A: Medical and scientific experts now agree that bacteria, not influenza viruses, were the greatest cause of death during the 1918 flu pandemic.\n",
      "\n",
      "Government efforts to gird for the next influenza pandemic ‚Äì bird flu or otherwise ‚Äì ought to take notice and stock up on antibiotics, says John Brundage, a medical microbiologist at the Armed Forces Health Surveillance Center in Silver Spring, Maryland.\n",
      "\n",
      "Brundage‚Äôs team culled first-hand accounts, medical records and infection patterns from 1918 and 1919. Although a nasty strain of flu virus swept around the world, bacterial pneumonia that came on the heels of mostly mild cases of flu killed the majority of the 20 to 100 million victims of the so-called Spanish flu, they conclude.\n",
      "\n",
      "‚ÄúWe agree completely that bacterial pneumonia played a major role in the mortality of the 1918 pandemic,‚Äù says Anthony Fauci, director of National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Disease in Bethesda, Maryland, and author of another journal article out next month that comes to a similar conclusion.\n",

      "Q: How is  lockdown partly responsible for excess deaths in the US ?\n",
      "A: As of October 15, 216,025 deaths from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been reported in the United States*; however, this number might underestimate the total impact of the pandemic on mortality. Measures of excess deaths have been used to estimate the impact of public health pandemics or disasters, particularly when there are questions about underascertainment of deaths directly attributable to a given event or cause (1‚Äì6).‚Ä† Excess deaths are defined as the number of persons who have died from all causes, in excess of the expected number of deaths for a given place and time. This report describes trends and demographic patterns in excess deaths during January 26‚ÄìOctober 3, 2020. Expected numbers of deaths were estimated using overdispersed Poisson regression models with spline terms to account for seasonal patterns, using provisional mortality data from CDC‚Äôs National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) (7). Weekly numbers of deaths by age group and race/ethnicity were assessed to examine the difference between the weekly number of deaths occurring in 2020 and the average number occurring in the same week during 2015‚Äì2019 and the percentage change in 2020. Overall, an estimated 299,028 excess deaths have occurred in the United States from late January through October 3, 2020, with two thirds of these attributed to COVID-19. The largest percentage increases were seen among adults aged 25‚Äì44 years and among Hispanic or Latino (Hispanic) persons. These results provide information about the degree to which COVID-19 deaths might be underascertained and inform efforts to prevent mortality directly or indirectly associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, such as efforts to minimize disruptions to health care.\n",
      "\n",
      "Estimates of excess deaths can provide a comprehensive account of mortality related to the COVID-19 pandemic, including deaths that are directly or indirectly attributable to COVID-19. Estimates of the numbers of deaths directly attributable to COVID-19 might be limi\n",
      "\n",
      "Q: Why is  lockdown directly attributed to COVID-19 which were observed in 2020 ?\n",
      "A: Based on NVSS data, excess deaths have occurred every week in the United States since March 2020. An estimated 299,028 more persons than expected have died since January 26, 2020; approximately two thirds of these deaths were attributed to COVID-19. A recent analysis of excess deaths from March through July reported very similar findings, but that study did not include more recent data through September (5).\n",
      "\n",
      "Although more excess deaths have occurred among older age groups, relative to past years, adults aged 25‚Äì44 years have experienced the largest average percentage increase in the number of deaths from all causes from late January through October 3, 2020. The age distribution of COVID-19 deaths shifted toward younger age groups from May through August (9); however, these disproportionate increases might also be related to underlying trends in other causes of death. Future analyses might shed light on the extent to which increases among younger age groups are driven by COVID-19 or by other causes of death. Among racial and ethnic groups, the smallest average percentage increase in numbers of deaths compared with previous years occurred among White persons (11.9%) and the largest for Hispanic persons (53.6%), with intermediate increases (28.9%‚Äì36.6%) among AI/AN, Black, and Asian persons. These disproportionate increases among certain racial and ethnic groups are consistent with noted disparities in COVID-19 mortality.***\n",
      "\n",
      "The findings in this report are subject to at least five limitations. First, the weighting of provisional NVSS mortality data might not fully account for reporting lags, particularly in recent weeks. Estimated numbers of deaths in the most recent weeks are likely underestimated and will increase as more data become available. Second, there is uncertainty associated with the models used to generate the expected numbers of deaths in a given week. A range of values for excess death estimates is provided elsewhere (7), but these ranges might not refl\n",

      "A: Biden railed against the Trump administration's countless attacks on the Affordable Care Act. As president, he promised to protect and build on the ACA. Although he wants to ensure healthcare is a right and not a privilege, he does not support Medicare-for-all or eliminating private insurance because it would mean getting rid of Obamacare and starting over on political negotiations.\n",

      "Q: How many federal judges did Trump nominated ?\n",
      "A: As of Thursday, Trump set a record for the most ever federal appeals judges confirmed during the first year of a presidency, Axios reports. Trump has successfully appointed 12 so far; President Barack Obama confirmed just three in his first year, and President George W. Bush confirmed six. He beat out presidents Richard Nixon and John F. Kennedy, who each confirmed 11.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q: How did Trump  nominated a full third of The United Supreme Court judges?\n",
      "A: Trump‚Äôs success at installing top-level judges ‚Äì he has placed more, faster, than any previous president ‚Äì has owed to the preparedness of outside groups in taking advantage of Republican control of both the presidency and the US Senate, which is in charge of confirming judges. Trump also has benefited from dozens of retirements by judges who were appointed by previous Republican presidents.\n",
      "\n",
      "But his best friend in the effort has been Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, who by blocking nominees under Barack Obama helped create 17 appeals court vacancies for Trump when he took office, more than any of his recent predecessors. McConnell also held a supreme court seat open for Trump, and he has changed Senate rules to speed the confirmation of Trump judges.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q: What impact did Trump‚Äôs judges made ?\n",
      "A: While experts advise that it could take five years or more for the full picture to develop of how Trump‚Äôs judges are changing the courts, and the country, signs are emerging of a potential phase shift.\n",
      "\n",
      "Formerly reliable progressive benches have issued rulings that threaten access to reproductive healthcare, while others have greenlighted the Trump administration‚Äôs most reckless attacks on voting rights and on vulnerable populations, from the disabled to victims of police abuse to asylum seekers.\n",

      "A: Harris recited a story about why Lincoln Waited to fill a vacancy on the supreme court. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"\"Abraham Lincoln was up for reelection, and it was 27 days before the election, and a seat became open on the United States Supreme Court. Abraham Lincoln's party was in charge, not only in the White House, but the Senate,\" Harris said. \"But Honest Abe said, it's not the right thing to do.

      "A: The Lincoln administration considered options before the chronically ill chief justice's death, but the Civil War and a historic election factored into the timing of naming a successor, according to \"Abraham Lincoln‚Äôs Appointments to the Supreme Court: A Master Politician at his Craft\" by Michael A. Kahn. An excerpt is posted to the website for the President Lincoln's Cottage museum.\n",

      "Candidates vying for Taney's position included ambitious climbers on both sides of the political aisle.

      "Q: Does prolonged Face Mask use leads to Oxygen deprivation ?\n",
      "A: Even if a person is wearing an airtight medical grade mask, like an N95 or FFP2 mask, the risks of lethargy, headache, and dizziness are low, even after wearing one for several hours. For an average healthy person wearing a cloth or surgical mask, there is even less risk of these symptoms occurring, because they still allow oxygen to flow out of the mouth and nose freely.\n",
      "\n",
      "While it might feel like breathing is more difficult in a mask and you are not getting enough air, that is likely a response to stress or anxiety from wearing the mask and can usually be helped by focusing on normal breathing patterns. Shallow breathing, hyperventilation, and breath holding can cause increases in carbon dioxide which leads to headaches and nausea. These symptoms are generally not caused by the use of masks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q: Does wearing a mask for long periods lead to CO2 intoxication ?\n",
      "A: Doctors typically refer to two distinct forms of oxygen deprivation: anoxic brain injuries occur when the brain is totally deprived of oxygen due to sudden cardiac arrest, choking, strangulation, and other sudden injuries. Hypoxic brain injuries occur when the brain receives less oxygen than it needs, but is not completely deprived of oxygen. Because the effects of the two injuries are similar, many brain experts use the terms interchangeably.\n",
      "\n",
      "A few seconds of oxygen deprivation won't cause lasting harm, so a child who holds his breath in frustration, a combatant choked unconscious during a Jiu-Jitsu match, and a diver who needs a few extra seconds to come up for air are unlikely to experience brain damage. The precise timeline of anoxic brain injuries depends on a number of personal idiosyncrasies, including overall brain and cardiovascular health, as well as the level of blood oxygenation at the time of injury. Generally speaking, injuries begin at the one-minute mark, steadily worsening thereafter.\n",
      "How Long Can the Brain Go Without Oxygen? A Timeline\n",
      "\n",
      "    Between 30-180 seconds of oxygen deprivation, you may lose consciousness.\n",
      "    At the one-minute mark, brain cells begin dying.\n",
      "    At three minutes, neurons suffer more extensive damage, and lasting brain damage becomes more likely.\n",
      "    At five minutes, death becomes imminent.\n",
      "    At 10 minutes, even if the brain remains alive, a coma and lasting brain damage are almost inevitable.\n",
      "    At 15 minutes, survival becomes nearly impossible.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are, of course, exceptions to every rule. Some training routines help the body make more efficient use of oxygen, enabling the brain to go longer periods without this vital element. Free divers routinely train to go long periods without oxygen, and the current record holder, Aleix Segura held his breath for 24 minutes and 3 seconds without sustaining brain damage!\n",

      "Q: Could posting ballots to the wrong address result in voter fraud?\n",
      "A: Possibly. 'More than half of states rely on signature matching to verify the identities of people who vote by mail. These states compare signatures they have on file (from voter registrations, ballot applications or the D.M.V.) with the ones voters put on their ballot envelopes.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the practice is not implemented consistently across states, or even within them.'\n",
      "A: There are multiple layers of security in place for mail-in ballots, which are also known as ‚Äúabsentee‚Äù ballots in many states.\n",
      "\n",
      "All 50 states and the District of Columbia require a voter to sign a statement or affidavit when voting by mail, and some also require personal information such as birth dates, addresses and driver‚Äôs license numbers. The signature can then be compared with the voter‚Äôs signature on file, usually from a voter registration form.\n",
      "\n",
      "Eight states also require a witness signature, while three states require notarization, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL). Alabama has perhaps the strictest rules, directing voters to submit copies of their IDs as well as signatures from either a notary or two witnesses.\n",
      "\n",
      "The return envelopes are typically opened by a different group of workers from those who scan the ballots. Outside observers, often appointed by a political party or campaign, are allowed to monitor post-election procedures, such as ballot counting. All but four states - North Carolina, Kansas, Maine and Florida - explicitly permit partisan observers to watch some post-election processes, according to the NCSL.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, ballots vary widely in appearance - not just from state to state but also from county to county and even from town to town, because most voters are not just making a choice for U.S. president but also for local offices. Any ballot that does not match the proper form will be rejected by election officials.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many jurisdictions use bar codes on ballot envelopes that can be used to help with ballot processing, according to the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University, a public policy institute. The bar codes also allow voters to track their ballots to ensure they have been received.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q: How are mail ballots processed and checked for voter fraud in Washington DC?\n",
      "A: Envelopes are scanned and marked\n",
      "as ‚ÄúReceived‚Äù in the VoteWA system,\n",
      "then sorted by precinct and district.\n",
      "Signatures are checked against voter registration records.\n",

      "\n",
      "Q: Is voter fraud via mail ballots a widespread problem accross America?\n",
      "A: No\n",
      "A: As election law professor Richard L. Hasen notes, during that period ‚Äúliterally billions of votes were cast.‚Äù While mail ballots are more susceptible to fraud than in-person voting, it is still more likely for an American to be struck by lightning than to commit mail voting fraud.\n",

All of the state‚Äôs active registered voters will automatically receive ballots in the mail, though there will still be some in-person polling locations across the state where people can cast a paper provisional ballot.\n",
      "\n",
      "Murphy said you can put your ballot in the mail, drop it in one of several secure boxes to be set up across the state, bring it to polling location on Election Day, or vote provisionally in person.\n",

      "Q: Have any issues/concerns been addressed in New Jersey about mail-in voter fraud?\n",
      "A: How common is voter fraud? - Voter fraud in the U.S. is historically rare, according to multiple studies and statistics. Nearly 1 in 4 voters cast ballots in the 2016 presidential election via mail.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, New Jersey has had issues with mail-in voting this year. - Some voters received the wrong ballots in the mail and some results took weeks to become official. Also, about 1 in 10 people who mailed in ballots in May‚Äôs special elections had their votes rejected.\n",

      "In 2020, the coronavirus has spurred 23 states and Washington D.C. to expand voting by mail. A total of 24 states now allow mail-in voting for any reason including fear of the coronavirus, compared with 16 in 2016. The number of states mailing ballots to all registered voters has also doubled, going from five in 2016 to 10 this year. The New York Times has reported that ballot request data indicates that more Democrats than Republicans are likely to vote by mail in 2020.\n",

      "‚ÄúIt would be very difficult to orchestrate some kind of national election fraud‚Äù\n",

      "\n",
      "Q: What is the status of voter fraud in the US?\n",
      "A: A comprehensive review by the Brennan Center of Justice found that voter fraud in the United States is rare and does not approach rates that would be required to ‚Äúrig‚Äù an election. An in-depth 2014 study published by the Washington Post found 31 credible instances of voter impersonation fraud from 2000 to 2014, out of a total of one billion ballots cast.\n",
      "\n",
      "There has been at least one instance of targeted mail-in ballot fraud this year, Dr. Atkeson said: -\n",
      "\n",
      "‚ÄúMail-in voting is not filled with fraud, but the fraud that we find is targeted in places where election results are going to be close. An example of this is a municipal election earlier this year in Paterson, New Jersey that was overturned after charges of mail-in voter fraud caused nearly 20 percent¬†of the ballots to be rejected.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q: What voter fraud security measures are in place?\n",
      "A: ‚ÄúSecurity checks should prevent the most egregious acts of fraud‚Äù\n",
      "More than half of states check the signatures on incoming mail-in ballots against signatures they have on file for registered voters, but Dr. Atkeson says that the rigour of these checks varies. \n",
      "\n",
      "    ‚ÄúEvery state has their own more or less stringent process for qualifying ballots. In states with universal vote-by-mail like Colorado and Utah, we certainly see instances where submitted ballots are signed by someone other than the voter   and those are caught. There are security checks that should prevent the most egregious acts of fraud. However, signature matching is not an exact science, both in terms of qualifying votes that should be counted and votes that shouldn‚Äôt be counted. But I do believe that processes in place are strong attempts to assure the security of the system.‚Äù\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Hood agrees:¬†‚ÄúIt really depends on the state - the United States basically has 50 different election systems with different safeguards. North Carolina has what they call witness affirmation   someone has to sign witnessing that the person sending the ballot voted the ballot. Another safeguard is if the state -- like Georgia -- requires voters to request absentee ballots. This way, the voter is initiating the process.‚Äù\n",
      "\n",
      "Q: What safeguards methods,  such as signature verification fraud security  are used in the state of New Jersey to prevent imposters from returning ballots in place of another voter?\n",
      "A: The county board of elections shall, promptly after receiving each mail-in ballot, remove the inner envelope containing the ballot from the outer envelope and shall compare the signature and the information contained on the flap of the inner envelope with the signature and information contained in the respective requests for mail-in ballots.  In addition, as to mail-in ballots issued less than seven days prior to an election, the county board of elections shall also check to establish that the mail-in voter did not vote in person.  The county board shall reject such a ballot if it is not satisfied, pursuant to a comparison with the Statewide voter registration system, that the voter is legally entitled to vote and that the ballot conforms with the requirements of this act.\n",
      "\n",
      "     In the case of a mail-in ballot to be voted at a primary election for the general election, the ballot shall be rejected if the mail-in voter has indicated in the certificate the voter's intention to vote in a primary election of any political party in which the voter is not entitled to vote according to the Statewide voter registration system, and if it shall appear from the record that the voter is not entitled to vote in a primary election of the political party which has been so indicated.\n",
      "\n",
      "Any mail-in ballot which is received by a county board of elections shall be rejected if both the inner and outer envelopes are unsealed or if either envelope has a seal that has been tampered with.  Mail-in ballots shall not be rejected due to missing or insufficient glue for either envelope.\n",
      "\n",
      "Disputes about the qualifications of a mail-in voter to vote or about whether or not or how any mail-in ballot shall be counted in such election shall be referred to the Superior Court for determination...\n",

      "Q: What studies have been made about the incidence of voter fraud in the US, and what were their findings?\n",
      "A: The Brennan Center reviews studies related the incidence of voter fraud. - The facts makes clear that fraud by voters at the polls is vanishingly rare, and does not happen on a scale even close to that necessary to ‚Äúrig‚Äù an election.\n",
      "\n",
      "Studies Agree: Impersonation Fraud by Voters Very Rarely Happens\n",
      "The Brennan Center‚Äôs seminal report on this issue, The Truth About Voter Fraud, found that most reported incidents of voter fraud are actually traceable to other sources, such as clerical errors or bad data matching practices. Incident rates between 0.0003 percent and 0.0025 percent. \n",
      "\n",
      "A study published by a Columbia University political scientist tracked incidence rates for voter fraud for two years, and found that the rare fraud reported could be traced to ‚Äúfalse claims by the loser of a close race, mischief and administrative or voter error.‚Äù\n",

      "\n",
      "The state and LA agreed to remove from the rolls 1.5 million individuals who remained registered even though they no longer were eligible to vote.

      "All-mail jurisdictions such as Oregon like to brag about the supposed ‚Äúsecurity‚Äù of their systems, which consists of almost nothing other than a rapid, superficial signature comparison.¬†\n",

      "Rose conducted a survey of one county, Washington County, outside Portland. Five percent of registered voters admitted that other people marked their ballots, and 2.4% said someone else signed their ballots.\n",
      "A: States have multiple tools to address valid security concerns and protect election integrity when it comes to mail ballots. And recent technologies and strategies have significantly enhanced the security of mail balloting.\n",
      "\n",
      "Identity verification: The principal method used to detect and prevent fraud is the mail ballot envelope itself, where each voter must include personal identifying information (such as address, birthday, and driver‚Äôs license number or last four digits of a Social Security number). In most states, that information includes a signature to match¬†against the voter rolls. \n",
      "\n",
      "Bar codes: Most election jurisdictions now use some form of bar code on their ballot envelopes. These bar codes allow election officials to keep track of ballot processing and help voters know whether their ballot has been received. Bar codes also allow states to identify and eliminate duplicate ballots.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ballot tracking through the U.S. Postal Service: In many jurisdictions, including California, Colorado and Florida, ballot envelopes are equipped with intelligent mail bar codes to track an envelope from drop-off to delivery and processing. \n",

      "Postelection audits: In 2018, a review of returned absentee ballot records helped identify anomalies in the election results of Bladen County, North Carolina, enabling election officials to uncover election interference by a political operative who stole and tampered with mail ballots.\n",

      "A: Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the first Jewish woman on the Supreme Court (and only the second woman on the Court), is a unique figure in the history of American law and of the twentieth- century women‚Äôs rights movement. After excelling at Harvard and Columbia law schools, she struggled to find a job because of sexism and antisemitism. While teaching at Rutgers University, she took on a few cases for the American Civil Liberties Union, then founded the ACLU‚Äôs Women‚Äôs Rights project, where her storied career as an advocate for gender equality began. In 1980, she was confirmed for the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, and in 1993 she became an associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court. In later years, she became a cultural icon to countless younger women and social justice advocates.\n",

      "A: On the high court, Justice Ginsburg was often called on to rule in cases regarding the rights of women and issues of gender equality. In 1996, she joined the majority in United States v. Virginia, ruling that the state could not continue to operate an all-male educational institution (the Virginia Military Institute) with taxpayer dollars. She also joined in the majority opinion in Stenberg v. Carhart (2000), striking down a Nebraska law banning so-called ‚Äúpartial birth‚Äù abortions. She dissented vehemently in Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire (2007), in which an Alabama woman sued unsuccessfully for back pay to compensate for the years in which she had been paid substantially less than junior male colleagues performing the same job. The U.S. Congress would later address the issue of pay equity through legislation known as the Lily Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009.\n",

If abortion restrictions were the main driver across the board, we‚Äôd expect the birth rate to increase,\" Nash said. \"There are a lot of potential factors at play, including increased access to affordable contraception (due to the Affordable Care Act among other policies that make it easier to afford contraception), new methods of contraception, and changing pregnancy desires and attitudes.\"\n",
      "\"I think it is an oversimplification to say there is an association between the abortion rate and the political party occupying the White House,\" said Dr. Daniel Grossman, a professor of obstetrics, gynecology and reproductive sciences at the University of California, San Francisco.\n",

      "Cuties, a film from French-Senegalese director Ma√Ømouna Doucour√©, made its debut in January at the 2020 Sundance Film Festival. Decider was there in Park City for the screening, and our Senior Film Reporter Anna Menta filed a review of Cuties, calling it a ‚Äúcoming-of-age film that will speak volumes to anyone who has lived through the agonizingly confusing time that is girlhood.‚Äù\n",

      "Earlier this week, Netflix announced the premiere date of Cuties (September 9) and released the trailer for the film, which immediately set off a firestorm of criticism from hordes of angry keyboard warriors ‚Äîmost of whom, we assume, have yet to actually see the movie‚Äî who found some fresh ammunition for the culture wars.

Combining that term with the precocious age of the film‚Äôs primary protagonist, an 11-year-old girl, left the rabid (and scarily thriving) QAnon community foaming at the mouth; it was the cultural equivalent of throwing red meat to Joe Exotic‚Äôs menagerie of underfed tigers.

      "A: Expand the scope of patient group directions (PGDs) to allow the administration of any medicine, including COVID-19 vaccines, the supply of which has been temporarily authorised under regulation 174 of the HMRs. PGDs are usually used to expand the professionals able to deliver prescription-only medicines to individuals. They are used, for example, as part of the annual national influenza immunisation programme by pharmacists working in community pharmacies.\n",

      "A: In New Brunswick, classes resumed in early September, as in many other parts of the country. The number of positive cases in the province is relatively low compared to other provinces in the country: as of September 10, 2020, 193 people were confirmed to have contracted the virus, of which 188 recovered and 2 died. Returning to the classroom requires increased monitoring of precautions and guidelines, which vary from one province or territory to another.\n",

      "A: Yes\n",

      "Q: Were the skies red just because of the flames/smoke?\n",
      "A: Particles from smoke, meanwhile ‚Äî like volatile organic compounds, dust, and soot ‚Äî are much larger than gas molecules, and they scatter light with longer wavelengths. That's a phenomenon called Mie scattering, and it's why skies turn orange and red due to wildfire smoke (it doesn't have to do with the color of the flames themselves).\n",
      "A: The reason for the sky turning red is the way smoke particles scatter sunlight. Smoke particles are fairly large and are better at scattering the longer (red) wavelengths of light, known as Mie scattering. If there a sufficient amount of smoke, Mie scattering will dominate over Rayleigh scattering, which is how light is primarily scattered in the atmosphere. This causes the red and orange colored sky.\n",

      "While individual women have spoken out before about forced birth control, the practice is far more widespread and systematic than previously known, according to an AP investigation based on government statistics, state documents and interviews with 30 ex-detainees, family members and a former detention camp instructor.

      "The population control measures are backed by mass detention both as a threat and as a punishment for failure to comply.

      "A: SB 145 does not change whether or not particular behavior is a crime and does not change the potential sentence for having sex with an underage person. Rather, the bill simply gives judges the ability to evaluate whether or not to require registration as a sex offender. To be clear, this judicial discretion for sex offender registration is *already* the law for vaginal intercourse between a 15-17 year old and someone up to 10 years older. SB 145 simply extends that discretion to other forms of intercourse.\n",

      "Q: What did the WHO say concerning the use of masks\n",
      "A: Masks are a key measure to suppress transmission and save lives.\n",
      "\n",
      "Masks should be used as part of a comprehensive ‚ÄòDo it all!‚Äô approach including physical distancing, avoiding crowded, closed and close-contact settings, good ventilation, cleaning hands, covering sneezes and coughs, and more.\n",
      "\n",
      "Depending on the type, masks can be used for either protection of healthy persons or to prevent onward transmission.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q: Can face masks prevent the spread of the COVID-19 virus\n",
      "A: More importantly, our data showed that masks worn by non-HCWs can also effectively prevent the spread of respiratory viruses and reduce the risk of virus infection by 56% in non-household settings, indicating the potential benefits of wearing masks for the general public. Moreover, significant protective effects were found in the study conducted in the general population indicating the potential benefits of wearing masks for the general public\n",
      "\n",
      "Q: Are ordinary fabric face masks recommended in working against COVID-19\n",
      "A: The use of ‚Äòfabric‚Äô face masks as an additional preventative measure against COVID-19 has been recommended for public use by the National Department of Health (NDoH). The spread of COVID-19 is mainly via respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes, similar to how influenza and other respiratory pathogens spread. Therefore, wearing a fabric face mask is added as a prevention measure to help limit community transmission of the virus\n",

      "Q: What can lower your immune system?\n",
      "A: When your immune system doesn't work the way it should, it's called an immune system disorder. You may:\n",
      "\n",
      "Be born with a weak immune system. This is called primary immune deficiency.\n",
      "\n",
      "Get a disease that weakens your immune system. This is called acquired immune deficiency.\n",

      "Have an immune system that turns against you. This is called autoimmune disease.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q: Can wearing a mask lower your immune system?\n",
      "A: Face masks help to limit contact with infectious droplets which carry pathogens. However, the material used for face masks are still porous enough to allow gas molecules, such as carbon dioxide and oxygen, to pass through, and do not significantly impair gas exchange to the point of causing hypercapnia. No scientific evidence supports the claim that the use of face masks weakens the immune system.\n",

      "A: Senate Bill No. 145\n",
      "\n",
      "Q: What does senate Bill No 145 say about sex with minors?\n",
      "A: Senate Bill 145 ends California‚Äôs anti-LGTBQ discriminatory treatment of specific sex acts regarding sex offender registry law. Under longstanding California law, if an adult has voluntary penile-vaginal intercourse with a minor aged 14, 15, 16, or 17 and is up to 10 years older than the minor, the offense is not automatically registerable. A judge has discretion whether or not to place the defendant on the sex offender registry. By contrast, if the sexual act is oral sex, anal sex or digital penetration, the court must place the defendant on the sex offender registry regardless of the facts of the crime and even in cases where the prosecutor does not want to place the defendant on the registry. This distinction in the law is irrational and discriminatory towards LGBTQ youth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q: Does SB 145 legalize sex with minors/pedophilia ?\n",
      "A: SB 145 DOES NOT legalize or weaken the penalties for any conduct. These offenses remain crimes punishable by law, and a judge can still CHOOSE to put the older party on the registry if the case warrants it. Just like a judge can do with an offense involving penile-vaginal intercourse.\n",
      " \n",
      "This bill only applies to young people aged 14, 15, 16 or 17 and anyone within a 10 year age range. The vast, vast majority of cases where a judge may decide NOT to put someone on the registry will be cases where the age range is close (such as 17-year-old and 18-year-old couple). At the end of the day, a judge will have full discretion to place someone on the registry, and a prosecutor can seek it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q: What is the age of consent in California?\n",
      "A: The age of consent remains unchanged. Under current law, it is ILLEGAL for anyone over 18 to have any type of sex with a 14, 15, 16 or 17 year old. This REMAINS ILLEGAL under SB 145 and is punishable by law. The only change is that a judge can decide, when the sexual contact is oral, anal or digital, whether or not the older party should be on the sex offender registry ‚Äì if the couple is close in age and the behavior was voluntary. Courts already hold this same discretion when the offense is penile-vaginal sex.\n",

      "Q: Does face masks cause hypoxia?\n",
      "A: Absolutely not. We wear masks all day long in the hospital. The masks are designed to be breathed through and there is no evidence that low oxygen levels occur. There is some evidence, however, that prolonged use of N-95 masks in patients with preexisting lung disease could cause some build-up of carbon dioxide levels in the body. People with preexisting lung problems should discuss mask wearing concerns with their health care providers. There is absolutely no scientific evidence that mask wearing or physical distancing weakens the immune system.\n",
      "A: There is no proof that wearing a mask can reduce oxygen levels, also known as hypoxia. The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S. CDC) recommend wearing cloth masks over a surgical mask in public, which are not too tight on our faces and allow for easy breathing.\n",

      "A: When asked by Guthrie if he would provide federally supported health coverage to undocumented immigrants, Biden quickly corrected her. \"You cannot let people who are sick, no matter where they come from, no matter what their status, go uncovered. You can‚Äôt do that. It‚Äôs just going to be taken care of. Period. You have to. It‚Äôs the humane thing to do,‚Äù he insisted.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q: Is undocumented immigrant healthcare expensive?\n",
      "A: Equitable coverage for undocumented immigrants makes financial sense. The federal government already covers urgent care, which is very expensive. The Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA) requires hospitals to stabilize all low-income individuals with life-threatening conditions, and Emergency Medicaid covers emergency services for immigrants who would otherwise qualify for Medicaid but for their immigration status. Thus, undocumented patients often receive care much later in the course of diseases, as documented in a study of New York City public hospitals. Often, individuals return repeatedly to emergency departments for the same condition. By delaying needed care, undocumented persons face serious, more costly, health conditions in the long term. Shifting toward prevention and early diagnosis and treatment would avoid or reduce costs over time.\n",

      "A: Joe Biden‚Äôs Build Back Better plan ensures that ‚Äì coming out of this profound public health and economic crisis, and facing the persistent climate crisis ‚Äì we are never caught flat-footed again. He will launch a national effort aimed at creating the jobs we need to build a modern, sustainable infrastructure now and deliver an equitable clean energy future.\n",
      "\n",
      "The current coronavirus crisis destroyed millions of American jobs, including hundreds of thousands in clean energy. It has exacerbated historic environmental injustices. And all this comes at a moment when the science tells us there is no time for delay on climate change. Biden will immediately invest in engines of sustainable job creation ‚Äì new industries and re-invigorated regional economies spurred by innovation from our national labs and universities; commercialized into new and better products that can be manufactured and built by American workers; and put together using feedstocks, materials, and parts supplied by small businesses, family farms, and job creators all across our country.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q: Does the Democratic Party of Joe Biden plan to essentially ban animal agriculture and eliminate gas-powered cars in 10 years ?\n",
      "A: INVEST IN SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE AND CONSERVATION \n",

      "    Mobilizing the next generation of conservation and resilience workers through a Civilian Climate Corps. Biden will put a new, diverse generation of patriotic Americans to work conserving our public lands, bolstering community resilience, and addressing the changing climate, while putting good-paying union jobs within reach for more Americans, including women and people of color. This initiative will be complemented by a new generation of scientists and land managers committed to ecological integrity and natural climate solutions. These workers will use sound, science-based techniques to thin and sustainably manage our forests, making them more resilient to wildfire and enhancing their carbon intake and habitat integrity; restore wetlands to protect clean water supplies and leverage greater flood protection; repair dilapidated irrigation systems to conserve water; plant millions of trees to help reduce heat stress in urban neighborhoods; protect and restore coastal ecosystems, such as wetlands, seagrasses, oyster reefs, and mangrove and kelp forests, to protect vulnerable coastlines, sequester carbon, and support biodiversity and fisheries; enhance the carbon intake of natural and working lands, wetlands, reefs, and underwater mangrove and kelp forests; remove invasive species; improve wildlife corridors; build hiking and biking trails and access to other recreational amenities; and reinvigorate landscapes and seascapes, unlocking economic and climate resilience in places like the Great Lakes, the Everglades, our nation‚Äôs great river systems including the Colorado River, and the Gulf of Mexic\n",

      "Q: Is the Democratic Party of Joe Biden pushing the so-called Green New Deal?\n",
      "A: The Sunrise Movement, which supported Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders in the Democratic primary, in April called on Biden to adopt the frameworks of the Green New Deal. When Biden released the new plan July 14, the group tweeted its support.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q: What is Joe Biden's plan for the Green New Deal?\n",
      "A: Biden‚Äôs overarching economic recovery plan, which includes his new climate plan. Biden‚Äôs campaign rolled out the Build Back Better agenda recently to address economic recovery for small businesses and families.\n",
      "\n",
      "The new $2 trillion climate plan sets a target for achieving net-zero emissions by 2050, which would balance out the emission and removal of greenhouse gases that warm the planet. His plan would make the electricity sector free of carbon pollution by 2035; make all new U.S.-made buses zero-emissions by 2030; set a goal for disadvantaged communities to receive 40% of benefits from \"clean energy\" and infrastructure spending; and create a net-zero emissions standard for all new commercial buildings by 2030. \n",
      "\n",
      "Biden is aiming to move toward a less carbon-intensive economy by creating millions of jobs to help reshape the country‚Äôs energy, transportation and infrastructure sectors, with workers being able to join unions and collectively bargain.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q: What is the Green New Deal?\n",
      "A: The Democratic debate over environmental issues has centered heavily around the Green New Deal, a plan to rapidly switch to clean energy to head off the worst projected effects of climate change.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, unlike other ideas that Democrats are discussing on the campaign trail, the Green New Deal is not a clear policy proposal in and of itself. Instead, it refers to a 14-page resolution sponsored by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and Sen. Edward Markey, D-Mass., that lays out a series of broad goals and guiding principles and then leaves it to lawmakers to figure out how to meet them.\n",
      "\n",
      "The resolution calls for ‚Äúa new national, social, industrial and economic mobilization on a scale not seen since World War II and the New Deal,‚Äù one that over 10 years would move to renewable energy for electricity, and make transportation, housing, agriculture and manufacturing more energy-efficient. The goal is to create millions of new jobs in clean energy and get to net-zero emissions by 2050, not only in the United States, but around the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q: Which presidential candidates are proposing the Green New Deal?\n",
      "A: Among the candidates who have put out plans along these lines are former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Sen. Kamala Harris of California, Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, former Rep. Beto O‚ÄôRourke, and businessman Andrew Yang.\n",
      "\n",
      "The plans differ in scale. Sander's, the largest by far, proposes $16 trillion in spending, paid for in part by fees on fossil fuel companies. Warren's plan calls for $3 trillion in federal investment over ten years, Biden calls for $1.7 trillion, and O'Rourke calls for $1.5 trillion, and they predict their plans would mobilize even larger contributions from the private sector.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q: Will the Green New Deal ban animal agriculture?\n",
      "A: There is no mention of banning animal agriculture.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q: Will the Green New Deal eliminate gas-powered cars?\n",
      "A: The rise of electric vehicles, however, doesn't automatically mean the end of the reign of the gas-powered car.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q: How does Joe Biden's plan differ from the Green New Deal?\n",
      "A: One difference between Biden‚Äôs original climate plan and his new one is the cost. The original plan would have invested $1.7 trillion over 10 years, while this plan proposes spending $300 billion more than that over a shorter period of time. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"All of those are sort of estimates that require a ton of assumptions, and the estimates are only as good as the assumptions you put in,\" Gross said. \n",
      "\n",
      "Biden plans to pay for this by raising the corporate income tax rate, increasing taxes on wealthy Americans and using stimulus money.\n",
      "\n",
      "The original plan did not include the goal to achieve a carbon-free pollution power sector by 2035. In addition, the new plan includes a proposal to create an Environmental and Climate Justice Division within the Justice Department. That idea was previously proposed by Democratic Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, who made climate change central to his presidential bid. Inslee supports Biden‚Äôs new approach.\n",
