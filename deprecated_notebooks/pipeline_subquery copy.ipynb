The high court also asks the Commission Elections (Comelec) to preserve election returns (ERs) that are subject to protest through a Precautionary Protection Order (PPO). The Marcos camp files a three-page letter-manifestation questioning the Comelec’s decision to issue a resolution approving the stripping of the vote-counting machines (VCMs) and laptops used in the May 9 polls, despite the PPO from PET. The stripping activity involves the backup of data from the automated election system so that Comelec can return the leased equipment to the service provider, Smartmatic International.

On May 27, 2016, Robredo was declared the winner after the closing of the canvassing of 166 certificates of canvass (COCs). Based on the official count of Congress sitting as the National Board of Canvassers, she garnered a total of 14,418,817 votes. Meanwhile, Marcos finishes second with 14, 155,344 votes.

Marcos asks the Supreme Court (SC) sitting as PET to set aside Robredo’s proclamation as vice president. He submits a 1,000-page petition that urges the PET to declare him as the Philippines’ duly elected and rightful vice president. Aside from the petition, he also presents 20,000 pages of affidavits, certificates of canvass (COCs), and other supporting documents. According to him, the votes for Robredo were “products of electoral frauds, anomalies, and irregularities.” Meanwhile, his votes “were significantly reduced, manipulated and altered” to make it appear that he placed behind Robredo in the race. Marcos challenges the results in 132,446 established polling precincts in 27 cities and provinces, covering 39,221 clustered precincts. He likewise asks to annul the election results in Basilan, Maguindanao, and Lanao del Sur, which he claims the poll fraud occurred.

Along with her husband, she was instrumental in creating strong cooperation between local government and civil society in her hometown through the creation of a local people’s council, according to Ramon Casiple, executive director of the Quezon City-based Institute for Political and Electoral Reform. “This brought Naga from a fifth-class city to a first-class city,” explained Casiple. But Robredo’s focus will now shift to Manila, where she will be dealing with the country’s new president: the tough-talking former mayor of Davao City, Rodrigo Duterte, who ran for the PDP-Laban party and secured a commanding six-million vote margin over the Liberal Party’s Manuel Roxas. Although Duterte and Robredo are both from regions far from the capital and have experience in local politics, there is potential for clashes. “The issue of human rights might divide them. Leni Robredo had a career as a defender of human rights, and Duterte is well known for his contempt for the human rights of criminals,” said The Asia Foundation’s Steven Rood. Moreover, Robredo only beat her vice-presidential rival, Ferdinand Marcos Jr, son of former dictator Ferdinand Marcos, by a narrow margin of 260,000 votes. Duterte recently declared he is a political ally of the Marcos family, which could leave Robredo sidelined. Furthermore, she is closely linked to the outgoing president, Benigno Aquino III, and his protégé for the vice-presidency, Mar Roxas – both Liberal Party stalwarts. Robredo has said she will support Duterte “100%” but, as Thompson explained, many of her supporters are hoping Robredo will prove a moderate counterpoint during his term in office. “The vice-presidency, while treated by many as a spare-tyre position, can be a powerful and influential one,” said Go.

A middle-aged woman stands on a nondescript Metro Manila street at night-time, her back to the camera, dressed in faded jeans and a striped top, waiting for a bus. But Leni Robredo, the woman in the picture, is now vice-president of the Philippines. After being taken and going viral on social media in early December, in the midst of the vice-presidential race, the image did much to cement the impression of a down-to-earth contender in the public’s eye. Until being elected to Congress as a member of the Liberal Party in 2013, Robredo lived most of her life in her hometown of Naga City in the Bicol region, southeast of Manila. Being a new face in politics, along with her distance from “well-entrenched” politicians, could work well for her, said Jan Robert R. Go, assistant professor in the Department of Political Science at the University of the Philippines Diliman. “She knows how people live and how life actually is, especially that national politics in the Philippines is dominated by Metro Manila interests,” Go said. But her appeal does not end there. She has some of what Mark Thompson, director of the Southeast Asia Research Centre at Hong Kong’s City University, calls “inherited charisma”. This was acquired from her late husband, popular statesman Jesse Robredo, who died in a 2012 plane crash. Many Filipinos see parallels with the late Corazon ‘Cory’ Aquino, who became president after the assassination of her husband and the overthrow of the Ferdinand Marcos dictatorship. “[In the election, Robredo] had the image of an honest female leader that distinguished her from the male Machiavellians who largely make up the Philippine political landscape,” said Thompson. And, although she has a limited track record in government that could be considered a weakness, “like Cory Aquino it was also a strength as she seemed to be unsullied by traditional politics”, Thompson added.

(BM-155) Using GIS maps to track & analyze the recent Philippines elections and results The recent elections in the Philippines and the accompanying results maps on many news websites and newspapers is the perfect example of how GIS Mapping software can be used to analyze elections and results through using spatial, location based data. Through using a relatively basic color coded theme tool, you can see who the most popular presidential and vice presidential candidates were by region. You also have the ability to plot and track on the map the amount of votes for each candidate by province/region, as well as the vote share/percentage in a way that is accessible and simple for your average voter to view and understand at a glance. With the ability to see which candidates were popular with voters in a particular region, we can gather and analyze useful data and make correlations as to why a specific candidate is popular in a certain areas, and much less popular in others. With a quick look at the simple map of the Philippines presidential election results, we can easily deduct that; - Rodrigo Duterte (Key - Red) was very popular in the capital region of Metro Manila and the instant surrounding areas and provinces. He was also extremely popular and gathered the most votes in the significant areas of the Visayas - Cebu, Bohol and Leyte. Duterte was also very popular in the majority of the whole region of Mindanao, where he served as the mayor of Davao for 22 years. He is also the only candidate who had significant support from all 3 key demographic regions of the Philippines - Luzon, The Visayas and Mindanao.

With a quick look at the simple map of the Philippines vice-presidential election results, we can easily deduct that; - Alan Peter Cayetano (Key Red) had significant parts of support in certain areas of the Mindanao region. This could be due to his association with Rodrigo Duterte - Being his running mate. Cayetano seems to have minimal support in any of the other areas or regions outside of Mindanao. - Francis Escuedero (Key Green) seems to have minimal support anywhere other than in small pockets of the Albay/Bicol region. - Gregorio Honasan (Key Orange) appears to have hardly any support from voters at all, with no pockets of orange to be seen anywhere on the map. - Ferdinand Marcos (Key Blue) appears to have a lot of support from most of the Luzon region including the capital city area of Metro Manila. The map shows that Marcos also seems to have a reasonable amount of support in spaced out pockets of The Visayas, and significant pockets of the Mindanao region. - Leni Robredo (Key Yellow) has a huge amount of support through nearly the whole of The Visayas Region as well as significant parts of the Mindanao Region.

She said the Marcos camp wrote the Comelec earlier that day asking about the new script. In the meantime, she said, the Marcos camp would wait for the official canvassing results while it continued to call for a stop to the PPCRV quick count. Citing the automated election law, Guanzon said the PPCRV was mandated to inform the public on the conduct of elections. “Under the law, quick count is allowed. There is no prohibition,” she said. “We have to be transparent to the people about the status of the voting. If we will conceal it, then many would have doubts. They might say there’s ‘magic’ involved.” In a separate interview, Comelec Chair Andres Bautista said the poll body had yet to receive a formal request from the Marcos camp. “Maybe it’s better if they send it to Congress where the official canvassing of votes for President and Vice President will be held. Comelec only canvasses votes for senators and party-list groups,” Bautista said. He challenged anyone with a complaint about the quick count to present evidence. “We are committed to being neutral. We are committing to count the votes as they come,” he said. At a press briefing, Robredo’s new spokesperson, Georgina Hernandez, lamented what she described as an attempt by the Marcos camp to condition the minds of the public about election rigging when the senator had no evidence to substantiate his claims. “The rise of Congresswoman Leni’s rating is due to the sweat and hard work of her supporters and volunteers.

His running mate, Allan Peter Cayetano, has given up the fight. But the fight continues for Leni Robredo and Ferdinand Marcos Jr. Robredo’s number spiked when the Mindanao votes started to come in. She got a greater number of votes from the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) at 408,397 compared to the 249,963 that Marcos garnered, based on the partial, unofficial 72.35 percent processed election returns. Both ARMM gubernatorial candidates– reelectionist Mujiv Hataman and Sulu vice governor Abdusakur Tan –belong to the pro-administration Liberal Party. They may have failed to deliver votes for the party’s standard bearer Mar Roxas as Duterte won by a wide margin in the region, but Robredo benefited from the LP machinery. Some analysts say Marcos had a dismal showing in the ARMM because of his family name. His namesake and father was the dictator blamed for starting the war in the region in the 1970s. It was during President Marcos’ administration that the Moro National Liberation Front was founded. It was also during this era that Muslims fell victims to human rights violations perpetrated by state security forces. The people’s experience under Martial Law may have also boosted Robredo’s numbers in the Caraga Region, where she got more than 120,000 votes against the dictator’s son, and in Northern Mindanao, where she garnered 680,148 votes, compared to Marcos’ 427,116. But in Central Mindanao, Marcos edged Robredo with at least 80,000 votes. It is only in Southern Mindanao where Cayetano became the frontrunner– garnering more than a million votes, more than half of Marcos’ 461,386 and Robredo’s 230,468 (94.74 percent partial, unofficial). Southern Mindanao is considered to be Duterte’s bailiwick. Even with Marcos getting more votes in Central and Southern Mindanao, these were not enough to overtake Robredo’s numbers.

In the 2016 congressional elections, no single party won an outright majority in either house, but President Duterte’s PDP-Laban Party secured unprecedented majority alliances in both chambers. While open and competitive, elections in the Philippines are typically marred by fraud, intimidation, and political violence. The 2016 national elections were credible, and while they were marked by dozens of incidents of election-related violence, including a number of killings, there were fewer such incidents compared to previous election years.

Hilbay, who served as solicitor general under the previous administration, led the Philippines’ case against China before the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague over disputed territories in the West Philippine Sea. As a human rights lawyer, Diokno vowed to improve the present justice system. Diokno chairs the Free Legal Assistance Group and is the founding dean of the De La Salle University College of Law. Macalintal, a veteran election lawyer, vowed to strengthen the government’s support and benefits given to senior citizens. '}, page_content='Benigno Aquino III, Leni Robredo endorse opposition Senate 12 MANILA, Philippines — Betting on their good and clean track record, Vice President Leni Robredo yesterday expressed confidence in the victory of candidates of the opposition coalition in the May 2019 senatorial elections. Robredo, who chairs the Liberal Party, led the presentation of the Oposisyon Koalisyon (OK) slate in Barangay Parang, Marikina City. The opposition candidates include former senator Mar Roxas, former Quezon congressman Erin Tañada, Maranao advocate Samira Gutoc-Tomawis, Magdalo Rep. Gary Alejano, human rights lawyer Jose Manuel “Chel” Diokno, election lawyer Romulo Macalintal, incumbent Sen. Paolo Benigno “Bam” Aquino IV and former solicitor general Florin Hilbay. Of the eight candidates, only Aquino, Tañada and Roxas belong to LP. Roxas was not able to attend the event because he is abroad, according to Aquino. “The eight candidates whom we will field come from different backgrounds but their capabilities are beyond question,” the Vice President said in a speech delivered in Filipino. Robredo admitted that these candidates are not as popular as some others, but she believes they will win as long as the public would unite for them, relating her own experience in the 2016 national election. “Many are saying that this will be a tough fight for them. But I think I’m the best example. Many have said that I didn’t have the chance (to win the vice presidency). But because the people united for me, the one percent to vice president became possible,” she said, referring to her initial ratings in surveys prior to the May 2016 polls. Apart from Robredo, former president Benigno Aquino III, Sen. Antonio Trillanes IV, Sen. Risa Hontiveros, Albay Rep. Edcel Lagman and Marikina Rep. Miro Quimbo also attended the event. Robredo said the opposition remains “very alive” despite being supposedly threatened by the present administration. ')], metadata=None)"

The Trump administration accused Billie Eilish of “destroying” the US in a new series of leaked documents, according to the Washington Post. On Thursday, the Post reported that the Trump administration had planned to roll out a public health campaign featuring numerous celebrities to help “defeat despair and inspire hope” amid the pandemic. But, in what appeared to be a move designed to support President Donald Trump ahead of Election Day, a top Trump administration official inserted “partisan political interests” into the $250 million advertising contract by disqualifying certain stars based on their political affiliations. Per the Post, the documents for the project (obtained by Democratic lawmakers) showed that some stars were ultimately excluded from consideration because they have criticized Trump, publicly supported Barack Obama, or were supportive of gay rights and same-sex marriage. Eilish, for example, was said to be unfit to participate because she was “not a Trump Supporter.” The documents also reportedly said that the 18-year-old was \"destroying our country and everything we care about.\" \\nOther stars, including Jennifer Lopez and director Judd Apatow, were also reportedly vetoed due to their past criticisms of the president.

Leaked internal documents obtained by the Post show an exhaustive list of celebrities who were approached to participate in the ad campaign, and everyone from Miranda Cosgrove to Meryl Streep is included, making the list a fascinating look at who’s famous at this moment… as well as which demographics the Trump administration thought each celeb could help reach. It’s quite a silly read. They think Lin-Manuel Miranda is perfect for Asian-American outreach, for some reason — perhaps just racist assumptions based on his name rather than any idea of who he is as a person. They seem to have ruled Christina Aguilera out of consideration because she “is a gay-rights supporting liberal,” whereas Lady Gaga’s entry bizarrely says she “has not specifically claimed any political side.” It’s a pop culture-obsessive’s delight, seeing through the looking glass at what conservatives apparently think of celebrities — who tend, typically, to be on our side. Many entertainment news outlets, though, chose to cover this story by zeroing in on one particular spreadsheet entry — the one about music’s it-girl Billie Eilish. In particular, outlets from the AV Club to Billboard, from NME and Complex to LoveBScott, all wrote something along the lines of: “Leaked documents show the Trump administration thinks Billie Eilish is ‘destroying our country and everything we care about.’” That’d be funny… if it were true.

The \"Bad Guy\" singer has been vocal in her disapproval of Trump. In August, Eilish performed her latest single during a virtual appearance at the 2020 Democratic National Convention. Before launching into her rendition of \"My Future,\" however, Eilish gave an impassioned speech decrying Trump and his handling of the coronavirus pandemic. \"You don\\'t need me to tell you things are a mess,\" Eilish said. \"Donald Trump is destroying our country and everything we care about. We need leaders who will solve problems like climate change and COVID, not deny them. Leaders who will fight against systemic racism and inequality.\" Eilish continued: \"And that starts by voting for someone who understands how much is at stake. Someone who\\'s building a team that shares our values. It starts with voting against Donald Trump and for Joe Biden. Silence is not an option, and we cannot sit this one out.\" Eilish pressed the importance of the election and told viewers \"to vote like our lives and the world depend on it, because they do.\" She concluded: \"The only way to be certain of the future is to make it ourselves.
