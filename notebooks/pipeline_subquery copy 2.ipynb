Finance Minister Patrick Chinamasa promised in a budget speech last week to re-engage with international lenders, curb spending and attract investors to revive the economy. '}, page_content='The African Export and Import Bank has pledged up to $1.5 billion in new loans and financial guarantees to Zimbabwe in a major boost for new President Emmerson Mnangagwa\\'s government, the bank\\'s president and chairman said Tuesday. Mnangagwa, who took over last month after veteran autocrat Robert Mugabe quit following a de facto military coup, has vowed to focus on reviving the struggling economy and provide jobs in a nation with an unemployment rate exceeding 80 percent. Afreximbank was the only international lender that stood by Zimbabwe throughout Mugabe\\'s repressive 37-year rule, but its quick announcement of a fresh package of loans and guarantees appeared to be a vote of confidence in the new government. Cairo-based Afreximbank was a major funder of Zimbabwe while the country was cut off from the International Monetary Fund and World Bank for having defaulted on its debt in 1999. Bank president and chairman Okey Oramah told reporters after a meeting with Mnangagwa and senior government officials that Afreximbank would provide $150 million to local banks to help them pay for outstanding critical imports. \"We also discussed a number of other areas that involve additional investment from us for something that will be in the order of $1 billion to $1.5 billion that will include certain kinds of guarantees to encourage investors to come to Zimbabwe. \"We ... want to make sure that we support the stabilization of the economy, that means providing liquidity to make sure that the situation where people are rushing every time to look for cash is dealt with,\" Oramah said. In August, before Mugabe\\'s ouster, Afreximbank provided $600 million to help Zimbabwe pay for imports and $300 million to allow it to print more \"bond notes,\" a quasi-currency that officially trades on par with the U.S. dollar. Zimbabwe has a foreign debt of more than $7 billion and in September said it would not be able to pay $1.8 billion in arrears to the World Bank and African Development Bank until economic fundamentals improved.

The independent daily Newsday quoted Biti as saying that Matabeleland firms received US$12 million of a total US$30 million disbursed by the Commercial Bank of Zimbabwe and Interfin under the Zimbabwe Economic and Trade Revival Facility to date, or 40 percent. He said more applications from the region had been expected. Biti attributed the low uptake of funds to a lack of information about how to apply for capital which is being made available at a 15 percent interest rate. The going market rate for business loans in Zimbabwe is close to 30 percent. Bankers said fewer than 200 companies nationwide have applied for loans ranging from US$250,000 to US$1.5 million. Banks disbursing the money declined to provide details on the application and approval process. Minister Biti was not available for comment. Bulisani Ncube, Matabeleland regional manager of the Zimbabwe National Chamber of Commerce said that government bureaucracy is hindering the placement of loans. “If the government does not make any effort to provide the necessary information about these loan facilities, we end up believing that such projects are crafted by some parties to gain political mileage,” Ncube said. Economist James Wade said the government should make sure that the loan application process is clearly explained to companies in need of working capital. Economist Prosper Chitambara agreed that red tape is impeding industrial revival. “I believe that whoever is in charge of managing these funds ought to be proactive in dealing with companies that require credit lines,” Chitambara said.

The Afreximbank Trade Debt-backed Securities (AFTRADES) will be provided to participating banks as debt securities that could be used as collateral for interbank funds placements in order to promote interbank dealings among Zimbabwean Banks active in trade finance, according to the terms of a memorandum of understanding signed on by Afreximbank, the Zimbabwe Ministry of Finance and Economic Development and the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe. “Our objective is to use this facility to enable trade finance banks in Zimbabwe to access much-needed liquidity from cash-surplus banks in the country, thereby increasing their capacity to deepen their trade finance activities,” said Jean-Louis Ekra, President of Afreximbank, after signing the memorandum of understanding in Cairo on 10 February. Patrick Chinamasa, Minister of Finance and Economic Planning, and Dr. Charity L. Dhliwayo, Acting Governor of the Reserve Bank, had signed it on 31 January on behalf of the Zimbabwean parties. Mr. Ekra said that Afreximbank’s decision to introduce the facility was motivated by its recognition of the serious constraints limiting the access of Zimbabwe’s trade finance banks to funding as a result of the liquidity challenge confronting the financial sector. Under the terms of the memorandum of understanding, AFTRADES would be structured as a collateral swap involving the issuance of securities by Afreximbank to participating banks in exchange for trade–related collateral or securities presented by those banks.

Only solvent banks which are not facing fundamental problems of viability will be eligible for the facility, according to the memorandum. The African Export Import Bank was established in October 1993 by African governments, African private and institutional investors, and non-African investors to finance and promote intra- and extra-African trade. Its two basic constitutive documents are the Establishment Agreement, which gives it the status of an international organization, and the Charter, which governs its corporate structure and operations.

'), Document(metadata={'url': 'https://www.brookings.edu/articles/zimbabwes-economic-reform-challenges/', 'context_before': 'Ten months ago, on August 26, 2015, Zimbabwe’s 92-year old leader, Robert Mugabe announced a 10-point plan to revitalize economic growth. Since then, the government has taken steps that signal the intention to transform a moribund economy. But the question is whether a Mugabe-led government can be successful in restoring growth and confidence in a once-promising economy that has been severely mismanaged for the better part of two decades. An economic reform initiative in Zimbabwe has been long overdue. GDP growth has dropped well below 2 percent, and the economy is half the size it was 15 years ago. The country is experiencing its most severe drought in 20 years due to El-Niño conditions and nearly three million people are at risk of starvation. Poverty is expected to rise in 2016, and the poor, especially in the rural areas, will be most impacted. Certain aspects of the reform initiative represent significant departures from past policies and deserve careful review. The bigger challenge is whether the program can succeed given the government’s poor track record on human rights, respect for the rule of law, and the intensifying competition to fill Zimbabwe’s growing leadership vacuum, given Mugabe’s advanced age. Moreover, the recent announcement by Reserve Bank Governor John Mangudya that he will introduce local “bond notes” has raised fears that the cash-strapped economy will return to the chaos and hyper-inflation that crippled the economy prior to the move to the dollar in 2009. Even though local coins have already been introduced into the economy, and Mangudya has a $200 million loan from the Africa Export-Import Bank to support the notes, his plan for a local currency has deepened the country’s economic anxiety, especially among Zimbabwean businesses and professionals. There is no question that Zimbabwe is taking strides to reform its economy. ', 'context_after': 'A fully functioning long-term lease program, including transferable title, would enable farmers to use their leases as collateral with commercial banks to secure loans. As important, 99-year leases would help restore the rule of law to a sector defined by violence, illegal seizures, and cronyism. Commercial banks, however, do not yet have sufficient confidence in the structure of the program or that land seizures have stopped completely and the banks have not begun to accept the leases as collateral for commercial loans to farmers. Perhaps the most unexpected reform was the March announcement made by Finance Minister Chinamasa that the government of Zimbabwe would pay “fair compensation” to the estimated 4800 white farmers forced off their land. Few issues have been as central to Zimbabwe’s isolation in the global community as the forced evictions and land seizures that began in 2000 and destroyed the country’s most productive economic sector. Sustained progress in restitution would be an important indicator of the government’s commitment to a new era of respect for the rule of law. The government expects to finance the compensation program, which according to some estimates would cost more than $10 billion, through the imposition of a land tax, treasury bills, and donor support. The government has since announced that it has begun to repay former white commercial farmers who lost land and has undertaken a countrywide effort to evaluate the seized farms in order to pay the former landholders for the improvements they made. However, the land compensation program has been described as an “illusion of reform,” by former Finance Minister Tendai Biti’s People’s Democratic Party (PDP). Indeed, under present circumstances, it is hard to envision Zimbabwe replicating Uganda’s experience where authorities have returned an estimated 3,493 of the more than 8,170 properties confiscated from the Asian community by Idi Amin in the early 1970s. '}, page_content='At the annual IMF/World Bank meetings in Lima, Peru last October. Zimbabwe’s finance minister, Patrick Chinamasa, and Mangyuda presented a plan to settle the country’s $1.8 billion debt to the international financial institutions (IFIs). Zimbabwe has been in default for 15 years to the IFIs and is the only nation in the world in arrears to the World Bank’s non-concessional lending window, the IBRD. The government recently completed successfully an IMF Staff Monitored program that has paved the way for this effort by building a favorable track record. The repayment plan is predicated on a loan of nearly $1 billion from Algeria, to be repaid over 10 years, and bridge financing of $400 million from the Africa Export-Import Bank that will be used to settle the country’s obligation to the African Development Bank. Given low oil prices, however, it is unclear when the loan will become available although Algerian authorities have indicated they intend to provide the resources. An element of flexibility has also been introduced into the government’s indigenization policy, Mugabe’s signature program that requires foreign investors to give majority control of their investments to locals. Line ministers, such as in agriculture and industry, are now able to negotiate indigenization plans with investors. While 51 percent equity will have to be handed over by foreign companies who invest in natural resources, “empowerment credits” can be negotiated to achieve the 51 percent threshold in other sectors. Even in its revised form, though, Zimbabwe’s indigenization policy is the most onerous set of local content requirements of any country in Africa and remains a significant deterrent to attracting new investment. Another reform proposed by the Zimbabwe government is a program now being advertised by the Ministry of Lands and Rural Resettlement that would enable farmers to lease land for 99 years.

Leaked internal documents obtained by the Post show an exhaustive list of celebrities who were approached to participate in the ad campaign, and everyone from Miranda Cosgrove to Meryl Streep is included, making the list a fascinating look at who’s famous at this moment… as well as which demographics the Trump administration thought each celeb could help reach. It’s quite a silly read. They think Lin-Manuel Miranda is perfect for Asian-American outreach, for some reason — perhaps just racist assumptions based on his name rather than any idea of who he is as a person. They seem to have ruled Christina Aguilera out of consideration because she “is a gay-rights supporting liberal,” whereas Lady Gaga’s entry bizarrely says she “has not specifically claimed any political side.” It’s a pop culture-obsessive’s delight, seeing through the looking glass at what conservatives apparently think of celebrities — who tend, typically, to be on our side. Many entertainment news outlets, though, chose to cover this story by zeroing in on one particular spreadsheet entry — the one about music’s it-girl Billie Eilish. In particular, outlets from the AV Club to Billboard, from NME and Complex to LoveBScott, all wrote something along the lines of: “Leaked documents show the Trump administration thinks Billie Eilish is ‘destroying our country and everything we care about.’” That’d be funny… if it were true.

Billie Eilish is destroying the very fabric of American life ... at least that\\'s how officials in Donald Trump\\'s administration view the pop sensation. Here\\'s the deal ... a top Trump administration official put a decidedly partisan spin on a $250 million campaign it wanted to roll out weeks before the election, aiming to \"defeat despair and inspire\" hope amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

Per the Post, the documents for the project (obtained by Democratic lawmakers) showed that some stars were ultimately excluded from consideration because they have criticized Trump, publicly supported Barack Obama, or were supportive of gay rights and same-sex marriage. Eilish, for example, was said to be unfit to participate because she was “not a Trump Supporter.” The documents also reportedly said that the 18-year-old was \"destroying our country and everything we care about.\" \\nOther stars, including Jennifer Lopez and director Judd Apatow, were also reportedly vetoed due to their past criticisms of the president. The Post reported that of at least 247 celebrities that were considered, only 10 were apparently approved: Dennis Quaid, Marc Anthony, Enrique Iglesias, Billy Ray Cyrus, Miranda Lambert, Garth Brooks, Dwyane Wade, Dr. Oz, CeCe Winans, and Shulem Lemmer. The \"Bad Guy\" singer has been vocal in her disapproval of Trump. In August, Eilish performed her latest single during a virtual appearance at the 2020 Democratic National Convention. Before launching into her rendition of \"My Future,\" however, Eilish gave an impassioned speech decrying Trump and his handling of the coronavirus pandemic. \"You don\\'t need me to tell you things are a mess,\" Eilish said. \"Donald Trump is destroying our country and everything we care about. We need leaders who will solve problems like climate change and COVID, not deny them. Leaders who will fight against systemic racism and inequality.\" Eilish continued: \"And that starts by voting for someone who understands how much is at stake. Someone who\\'s building a team that shares our values. It starts with voting against Donald Trump and for Joe Biden. Silence is not an option, and we cannot sit this one out.\" Eilish pressed the importance of the election and told viewers \"to vote like our lives and the world depend on it, because they do.\" She concluded: \"The only way to be certain of the future is to make it ourselves.

The article on Thursday — in part about hundreds of celebrities being vetted for a Trump administration coronavirus ad campaign — included a misattributed quote from the White House about Eilish. “Donald Trump is destroying our country and everything we care about,” the Grammy-winning singer said at the Democratic National Convention in August. Citing leaked documents obtained by Democratic House lawmakers, the Washington Post incorrectly wrote that the Trump officials described Eilish as “not a Trump supporter,” saying she is “destroying our country and everything we care about.” A screenshot of the leaked papers showed that Trump officials’ description of Eilish was clear — they said the “Bad Guy” singer “made a political statement on gun control in 2019; will be a first time voter in 2020; not a Trump supporter, stated he ‘is destroying our country and everything we care about.'” The flub was picked up by Vice editor Jill Krajewski, who noted that “an embarrassing number of music outlets” including Complex, NME, Consequence of Sound and The Fader aggregated the misreported Washington Post story. On Friday, a correction appeared on the Washington Post story. \\n\", answer_type='Boolean')], metadata={'suggested_label': 'Refuted', 'label_confidences': array([0.83095266, 0.01521943, 0.0413707 , 0.11245721]), 'llm_type': 'gpt-4o', 'llm_output': {'questions': [{'question': 'Did the Trump administration accuse Billie Eilish of destroying the country?', 'answer': \"No, the Trump administration did not accuse Billie Eilish of destroying the country.

First Lady Melania Trump’s speech from the White House Rose Garden lifted the TV audience for the Republican National Convention to 19.4 million viewers, an improvement over the opening night. The figure from Nielsen is up 14% from the 17 million who watched the Repubicans on Monday. In 2016, the first time Republicans nominated President Trump, the audience for the second night of the convention was 19.8 million, the smallest audience of the week for the event. The Republicans’ audience on Tuesday was slightly better than the second night of the Democratic National Convention held last week, which had 19.2 million viewers. Over four nights, the DNC’s presentation averaged 21.6 million viewers. Melania Trump sought to recast her husband’s image in an RNC speech that was often at odds with the hard-edged reality of the Trump presidency. Since 1960, the Democratic convention has scored higher ratings than the Republican one in all but four of the last 15 presidential campaign cycles. The ratings have not been an indicator of success in the presidential election; the party with the most-watched convention has won the White House in seven of those races. But the Republicans’ improvement on the second night should please Trump, a close watcher of the Nielsen ratings since his days as host of the NBC reality show “The Apprentice.” Fox News was the most-watched channel for coverage between 10 and 11:15 p.m. Eastern on Tuesday, with an average of 7.9 million viewers, followed by NBC (2.5 million), CNN (2.12 million), ABC (2.09 million), MSNBC (1.9 million) and CBS (1.5 million). The audience for Fox News, the favorite network of Trump supporters, is the largest ever for a cable network on the second night of a political convention. Coverage also ran on Fox Business Network, Newsy, Newsmax, CNN en Español and PBS. \\nAlong with the first lady, speakers in the hour included Secretary of State Michael R. Pompeo, Kentucky Atty.

It was a familiar topic for the Republican candidate, who has said for weeks that the television ratings for his nominating convention -- packed with big stars like Scott Baio and an underwear model whose name I\\'ve already forgotten -- would be spectacular. As the New York Times reported, however, the party\\'s gathering in Cleveland \"did not live up to the hype.\" About 32 million Americans watched Mr. Trump\\'s climactic acceptance speech on Thursday evening on the major cable news and broadcast channels, according to ratings from Nielsen, released on Friday. Mr. Trump\\'s remarks, at an hour and 15 minutes the longest in modern convention history, just beat out those of the previous Republican nominee, the decidedly less unpredictable Mitt Romney, who was seen by about 1.9 million fewer viewers when he addressed the party\\'s convention four years ago. Viewership throughout the convention week was about the same as in 2012. To help put this in perspective, the Times piece noted that the first debate for the GOP presidential candidates, aired last August, brought in 24 million viewers. The second night of the Republican convention brought in under 20 million \"across all the major news networks.\" Adding insult to injury, for all of his interest in television ratings, Trump\\'s audience failed to match that of a certain former POW whose service Comparing convention to convention can be tricky because the number of nights do not always match up, but consider the size of the television audiences over the last three cycles for the Republican nominees\\' acceptance speeches: To be sure, 32.2 million people is a sizable television audience, but Trump had the night all to himself, with considerable interest in what he\\'d have to say, and the numbers fell short of what many expected. \\nOn Friday morning, before the final numbers were available, Trump boasted on Twitter that the GOP convention was \"one of the best produced, including the incredible stage & set, in the history of conventions.\" ', answer_type='Extractive'), Evidence(question='What was the US carbon emission trend between 2017 and 2018?', answer='US carbon emissions rose by 3.4% in 2018 after three years of decline.', url='https://www.poynter.org/newsletters/2020/controversy-and-a-comeback-highlight-night-two-of-the-republican-national-convention/', scraped_text='- The Republicans hit on many of their go-to talking points on Tuesday night, including the economy, religious freedom, abortion and, in a speech delivered by former Covington Catholic High School student Nicholas Sandmann, “cancel culture” and the media. On the economy, National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow bragged about how well the country is doing, but his speech was immediately fact-checked on PBS by Yamiche Alcindor and by MSNBC, which spent much of the night fact-checking speeches. NBC News senior business correspondent Stephanie Ruhle also called out Kudlow, saying, “We know that before COVID hit, the economy was strong. It was growing. And then corona happened, and it put us in a health and an economic crisis. And the thing is, neither are over. And while we’re living in corona, nothing is booming.” - One topic pretty much ignored, except for Melania Trump’s speech, was the coronavirus. NBC News’ Chuck Todd said, “I think it’s a really big risk to ignore the virus the way they have ignored it tonight.” - Speaking of Todd, he talked about two other topics that the Trump campaign has really hammered home over the first two days: criminal justice reform and Trump’s assertion that he is the president for people of color. Todd said, “Both campaigns tell me that there is a chance that Donald Trump could overperform with African American men. It’s a concern of the Biden campaign and it’s a focus of the Trump campaign.” - Clever point of the night: Univision New York’s Jose Pagliery tweeted that while former Florida attorney general Pam Bondi was, during her speech, accusing Joe Biden of nepotism, the chyron on CNN showed the upcoming speakers: Tiffany Trump, Eric Trump, Melania Trump. - As far as those speeches from family members, they were … odd. They weren’t personal at all. No anecdotes from the kitchen table, no stories about growing up, no memories of camping trips or Christmas mornings. \\nAs ABC News’ George Stephanopoulos said, “Of course, family members are always used at conventions, there’s no question about that. Usually, though, they’re used to soften up the candidate, humanize the candidate in some way. What we’re seeing here are real political speeches.” Now, for the somewhat complicated look at TV ratings for Monday’s first night of the Republican National Convention. First, the actual numbers on the ratings for the traditional outlets — ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN, Fox News and MSNBC. Monday’s opening night of the Republican National Convention averaged around 17 million viewers — a significant 26% drop from the opening night of 2016. It’s also below what the Democrats drew last week for their opening night. The DNC drew 19.7 million viewers, which also was about a 24% drop from 2016. So what does it all mean? Well, interest was down. Maybe. These numbers show who was actually watching the TV broadcasts. But that doesn’t take into account all those who watched on streaming services and who will watch portions of the first night (notable speeches, for instance) later on platforms such as Twitter, Facebook and YouTube. The point: TV numbers are revealing, but not that revealing. A lot of factors are in play this election cycle that haven’t been in play before, particularly the viewing habits of people who are just as likely to watch something on YouTube or Twitter as they are television. While watching something on the internet is not new, it is more prevalent than ever. Back to Monday night’s viewership. No surprise, Fox News was the night’s big winner, averaging 7.1 million viewers between 10 and 11 p.m. Eastern. As far as the cable networks, CNN drew 2 million viewers and MSNBC drew 1.6 million. Among the major networks, ABC drew 1.9 million viewers, followed by NBC (1.7 million) and CBS (1.5 million). \\nNetworks are going to have some tough choices to make tonight. While the Republicans are holding their national convention, a Category 3 hurricane is expected to be bearing down somewhere on the Gulf Coast. While the major networks — ABC, CBS and NBC — will likely go with the original plan of convention coverage from 10 to 11 p.m. Eastern, what will the cable networks do? Specifically, CNN and Fox News? A Cat 3 hurricane is a huge life-and-death story that normally would dominate any cable news outlet. Should that change just because there is a political convention going on? CNN is expected to have reporters on the scene wherever the storm makes landfall, and, surely, will have coverage throughout the day. They likely will split coverage between the convention and the storm. Fox News correspondent Leland Vittert will be reporting live from somewhere near the storm, as will Charles Watson and Caroline Shively. Look for Fox News to mostly stick with convention coverage — well, in between Sean Hannity and Tucker Carlson — and then concentrate on hurricane coverage in the overnight hours. In addition, wildfires continue to burn up large chunks of California, while Wisconsin and other parts of the country are seeing protests following a police officer shooting a Black man in the back seven times in Kenosha, Wisconsin. The New York Times’ Michael M. Grynbaum reported Tuesday that the major TV networks lodged a protest during a heated call with Republican officials because Fox News was given additional access to major convention speeches. The complaints came after Fox News host Sean Hannity said he would be broadcasting from the site of several upcoming speeches. On his show, Hannity said, “We’ll be broadcasting live from the Rose Garden in the lead-up for Melania Trump’s speech (Tuesday) night. Wednesday, we’ll be at Fort McHenry where Vice President Pence will be, and on Thursday, we will be live on the South Lawn where President Trump will give his speech.” ', answer_type='Extractive'), Evidence(question='What was the US carbon emission trend between 2018 and 2019?', answer='US carbon dioxide emissions fell again in 2019, according to several recent international reports.', url='https://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/355134/dnc-wins-first-night-of-convention-ratings-but-ha.html', scraped_text='\\nRatings for the first night of the Republican National Convention trailed the first night of the Democratic National Convention by 14%, according to estimates for the common television network coverage, but the DNC had a greater falloff than the RNC from the first night of their 2016 convention ratings.

But audiences for the DNC\\'s opening night were down 34% from the first night of its 2016 convention, versus only a 26% drop for the first night of the RNC this year vs. 2016. The biggest audiences historically go to the fourth and final night of the conventions, and this year the DNC\\'s last night delivered 24.6 million viewers, down 17% from the fourth night of 2016\\'s DNC convention coverage. Joe, I wonder what the \"total audience\" of each convention\\'s first night was taking into account those who may have sampled some of the content but then tuned out?

The figure from Nielsen is up 14% from the 17 million who watched the Repubicans on Monday. In 2016, the first time Republicans nominated President Trump, the audience for the second night of the convention was 19.8 million, the smallest audience of the week for the event. The Republicans’ audience on Tuesday was slightly better than the second night of the Democratic National Convention held last week, which had 19.2 million viewers. Over four nights, the DNC’s presentation averaged 21.6 million viewers. Melania Trump sought to recast her husband’s image in an RNC speech that was often at odds with the hard-edged reality of the Trump presidency. Since 1960, the Democratic convention has scored higher ratings than the Republican one in all but four of the last 15 presidential campaign cycles. The ratings have not been an indicator of success in the presidential election; the party with the most-watched convention has won the White House in seven of those races. But the Republicans’ improvement on the second night should please Trump, a close watcher of the Nielsen ratings since his days as host of the NBC reality show “The Apprentice.” Fox News was the most-watched channel for coverage between 10 and 11:15 p.m. Eastern on Tuesday, with an average of 7.9 million viewers, followed by NBC (2.5 million), CNN (2.12 million), ABC (2.09 million), MSNBC (1.9 million) and CBS (1.5 million). The audience for Fox News, the favorite network of Trump supporters, is the largest ever for a cable network on the second night of a political convention.

NBC News senior business correspondent Stephanie Ruhle also called out Kudlow, saying, “We know that before COVID hit, the economy was strong. It was growing. And then corona happened, and it put us in a health and an economic crisis. And the thing is, neither are over. And while we’re living in corona, nothing is booming.” - One topic pretty much ignored, except for Melania Trump’s speech, was the coronavirus.

While the Republicans are holding their national convention, a Category 3 hurricane is expected to be bearing down somewhere on the Gulf Coast. While the major networks — ABC, CBS and NBC — will likely go with the original plan of convention coverage from 10 to 11 p.m. Eastern, what will the cable networks do? Specifically, CNN and Fox News? A Cat 3 hurricane is a huge life-and-death story that normally would dominate any cable news outlet. Should that change just because there is a political convention going on? CNN is expected to have reporters on the scene wherever the storm makes landfall, and, surely, will have coverage throughout the day. They likely will split coverage between the convention and the storm. Fox News correspondent Leland Vittert will be reporting live from somewhere near the storm, as will Charles Watson and Caroline Shively. Look for Fox News to mostly stick with convention coverage — well, in between Sean Hannity and Tucker Carlson — and then concentrate on hurricane coverage in the overnight hours. In addition, wildfires continue to burn up large chunks of California, while Wisconsin and other parts of the country are seeing protests following a police officer shooting a Black man in the back seven times in Kenosha, Wisconsin. The New York Times’ Michael M. Grynbaum reported Tuesday that the major TV networks lodged a protest during a heated call with Republican officials because Fox News was given additional access to major convention speeches. The complaints came after Fox News host Sean Hannity said he would be broadcasting from the site of several upcoming speeches. On his show, Hannity said, “We’ll be broadcasting live from the Rose Garden in the lead-up for Melania Trump’s speech (Tuesday) night. Wednesday, we’ll be at Fort McHenry where Vice President Pence will be, and on Thursday, we will be live on the South Lawn where President Trump will give his speech.” '}, page_content='As ABC News’ George Stephanopoulos said, “Of course, family members are always used at conventions, there’s no question about that. Usually, though, they’re used to soften up the candidate, humanize the candidate in some way. What we’re seeing here are real political speeches.” Now, for the somewhat complicated look at TV ratings for Monday’s first night of the Republican National Convention. First, the actual numbers on the ratings for the traditional outlets — ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN, Fox News and MSNBC. Monday’s opening night of the Republican National Convention averaged around 17 million viewers — a significant 26% drop from the opening night of 2016. It’s also below what the Democrats drew last week for their opening night. The DNC drew 19.7 million viewers, which also was about a 24% drop from 2016. So what does it all mean? Well, interest was down. Maybe. These numbers show who was actually watching the TV broadcasts. But that doesn’t take into account all those who watched on streaming services and who will watch portions of the first night (notable speeches, for instance) later on platforms such as Twitter, Facebook and YouTube. The point: TV numbers are revealing, but not that revealing. A lot of factors are in play this election cycle that haven’t been in play before, particularly the viewing habits of people who are just as likely to watch something on YouTube or Twitter as they are television. While watching something on the internet is not new, it is more prevalent than ever. Back to Monday night’s viewership. No surprise, Fox News was the night’s big winner, averaging 7.1 million viewers between 10 and 11 p.m. Eastern. As far as the cable networks, CNN drew 2 million viewers and MSNBC drew 1.6 million. Among the major networks, ABC drew 1.9 million viewers, followed by NBC (1.7 million) and CBS (1.5 million).

It may not have been the traditional, crowd-filled production the president and his party originally wanted to celebrate, but the first night of the Republican National Convention featured a slew of speakers, videos, and even appearances from the president himself. Through it all, the president's party offered haunting interpretations of the current political and cultural landscape.

GOP unites behind Trump while offering a dark assessment of America The first night of the 2020 Republican National Convention cemented how far the party has come in terms of unity over the course of the last four years. In 2016, delegates audibly booed against the nomination of Donald Trump on the floor of Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland, and rumblings of a contested convention loomed over the lead-up to the typically celebratory event. Monday night's largely virtual choreography offered no room for visible disagreement even if it existed, and the evening presented a sharp shift from any past political uncertainty as Republicans united in their vehement praise of Trump, while offering apocalyptic depictions of what the nation would look like without the incumbent remaining in the Oval Office. Charlie Kirk, the 26-year-old president and founder of the conservative student group Turning Point USA, kicked off the night with a dark warning. \"), Document(metadata={'url': 'https://ew.com/article/2004/09/04/gop-convention-outdraws-democratic-confab-among-viewers/', 'context_before': '', 'context_after': ''}, page_content=\"TV Article GOP convention outdraws Democratic confab among viewers GOP convention outdraws Democratic confab among viewers.

One was that it had been observed that convention bounces had been more minuscule in recent elections. Per some calculations, convention bounces had averaged just 2 points since 2004, compared to just under 7 points between 1968 and 2000.[253] Per other calculations, average bounces since 1996 averaged 3.6 points while bounces between 1962 and 1992 averaged 6.3 points.[255] Another factor cited for why it was seen as unlikely for either party to generate a significant convention bounce in 2020 was that polls in the 2020 race had, in the months prior to the convention, shown a remarkably steady race, with Biden consistently holding an average lead of 6 points, exceeding a 10-point lead in some polls and never slipping below a lead of 4 points in the polling average. It has been shown that more stable races tend to see smaller convention bounces.[253][256] Another was that the conventions, having been scaled-back due to the COVID-19 pandemic, were seen as less likely to generate as much attention as past conventions had, particularly due to the decrease in television viewership.[253][254] Another was that the electorate was already strongly opinionated on the candidates, with more voters holding a strong opinion on Trump than any incumbent since at least 1980, and more voters holding a strong opinion on Biden than any challenger to an incumbent since at least 1980.[253] Races where voters hold strong opinions on the candidates tend to see smaller convention bounces.[253] Strong partisanship among the electorate was another cited factor.[256] - ^ WCNC Staff (October 1, 2018). \"WCNC: 2020 Republican National Convention dates announced\".
