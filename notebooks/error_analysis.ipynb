Throughout history, members of both parties in Congress and in the White House have done their jobs so that the Judicial Branch can do its own. Failing to do so would be an unprecedented dereliction of duty. The Senate has almost a full year to consider and confirm a nominee. In fact, since 1975, the average time from nomination to confirmation is 67 days. The longest time before confirmation in the past three decades was 99 days, for Justice Thomas, and the last four Justices, spanning two Administrations, were confirmed in an average of 75 days. Six Justices have been confirmed in a presidential election year since 1900. Every nominee who was not withdrawn has received a vote within 125 days of nomination. It will be harmful and create unsustainable uncertainty if Congress fails to act on the President's nominee. Here's a look at where President Obama's Supreme Court nominee stands in the confirmation process compared to those of recent nominees under three different administrations. Q: Has Judge Garland issued opinions hostile to gun owners? A: No. Chief Judge Garland has never issued or joined an opinion involving the Second Amendment. Some right-wing special interest groups are spending millions of dollars trying to distort Judge Garland’s record by misrepresenting his votes in two cases. Independent fact-checkers have already deemed those attacks “false,” but let’s look at the facts. In 2008, a D.C. Circuit panel that did not include Chief Judge Garland struck down parts of a Washington, D.C. gun control law in Parker v. District of Columbia, a decision that was eventually affirmed by the Supreme Court in District of Columbia v. Heller. Chief Judge Garland joined one of President George H.W. Bush’s appointees and two other judges in voting to grant rehearing by the full court. \\nA vote for rehearing by the full court is simply a request to have more judges take a look at the legal matter. Judge Garland’s vote to request rehearing does not indicate anything about his views on the Second Amendment. The D.C. Circuit’s rules say that rehearing by the full court is only appropriate in certain circumstances, such as where the case involves a question of exceptional importance. As Chief Justice Roberts explained at his confirmation hearing, there are many reasons judges vote for rehearing, including that a case involves important questions that the court “ought to look at” more closely. This case was the first federal court decision to strike down a statute on Second Amendment grounds in decades. Chief Judge Garland was also on the D.C. Circuit when it denied full court rehearing in Heller II, a September 2015 panel decision invalidating various portions of a new D.C. gun control law under the Second Amendment. The second case, the 2000 decision in NRA v. Reno, does not reflect any views on the Second Amendment, but rather Chief Judge Garland’s careful case-by-case approach to judging. This case was about a Justice Department regulation that allowed the Department to temporarily retain certain data generated during background checks of prospective firearms purchasers that are required by federal law. The Department kept the data for a limited period to review the background system to ensure accuracy and privacy. Garland voted with the majority to uphold the regulation, in an opinion that concluded that the Department had reasonably interpreted the Brady Act to permit retaining the data temporarily to conduct audits. The D.C. Circuit emphasized that the audit records did not represent a “system for the registration of firearms, firearms owners, or firearms transactions” and that the creation of any such system would be barred by statute. The case was about administrative law and did not mention the Second Amendment. \", 'answer_type': 'Extractive'}, {'question': 'How long did it take for Elena Kagan to be confirmed?', 'answer': '87 days', 'url': 'https://www.npr.org/2016/02/14/466723547/7-things-to-know-about-presidential-appointments-to-the-supreme-court', 'scraped_text': \"Rutledge is the earliest rejection of a nominee (by a 14-10 vote and also the only recess appointment to be rejected).

       "The confirmation of a Supreme Court Justice is a solemn responsibility that the President and the Senate share under the U.S. Constitution. Throughout history, members of both parties in Congress and in the White House have done their jobs so that the Judicial Branch can do its own. Failing to do so would be an unprecedented dereliction of duty. The Senate has almost a full year to consider and confirm a nominee. In fact, since 1975, the average time from nomination to confirmation is 67 days. The longest time before confirmation in the past three decades was 99 days, for Justice Thomas, and the last four Justices, spanning two Administrations, were confirmed in an average of 75 days. Six Justices have been confirmed in a presidential election year since 1900. Every nominee who was not withdrawn has received a vote within 125 days of nomination. It will be harmful and create unsustainable uncertainty if Congress fails to act on the President's nominee. Here's a look at where President Obama's Supreme Court nominee stands in the confirmation process compared to those of recent nominees under three different administrations. Q: Has Judge Garland issued opinions hostile to gun owners? A: No. Chief Judge Garland has never issued or joined an opinion involving the Second Amendment. Some right-wing special interest groups are spending millions of dollars trying to distort Judge Garland’s record by misrepresenting his votes in two cases. Independent fact-checkers have already deemed those attacks “false,” but let’s look at the facts. In 2008, a D.C. Circuit panel that did not include Chief Judge Garland struck down parts of a Washington, D.C. gun control law in Parker v. District of Columbia, a decision that was eventually affirmed by the Supreme Court in District of Columbia v. Heller. Chief Judge Garland joined one of President George H.W. Bush’s appointees and two other judges in voting to grant rehearing by the full court. \n",
       "A vote for rehearing by the full court is simply a request to have more judges take a look at the legal matter. Judge Garland’s vote to request rehearing does not indicate anything about his views on the Second Amendment. The D.C. Circuit’s rules say that rehearing by the full court is only appropriate in certain circumstances, such as where the case involves a question of exceptional importance. As Chief Justice Roberts explained at his confirmation hearing, there are many reasons judges vote for rehearing, including that a case involves important questions that the court “ought to look at” more closely. This case was the first federal court decision to strike down a statute on Second Amendment grounds in decades. Chief Judge Garland was also on the D.C. Circuit when it denied full court rehearing in Heller II, a September 2015 panel decision invalidating various portions of a new D.C. gun control law under the Second Amendment. The second case, the 2000 decision in NRA v. Reno, does not reflect any views on the Second Amendment, but rather Chief Judge Garland’s careful case-by-case approach to judging. This case was about a Justice Department regulation that allowed the Department to temporarily retain certain data generated during background checks of prospective firearms purchasers that are required by federal law. The Department kept the data for a limited period to review the background system to ensure accuracy and privacy. Garland voted with the majority to uphold the regulation, in an opinion that concluded that the Department had reasonably interpreted the Brady Act to permit retaining the data temporarily to conduct audits. The D.C. Circuit emphasized that the audit records did not represent a “system for the registration of firearms, firearms owners, or firearms transactions” and that the creation of any such system would be barred by statute. The case was about administrative law and did not mention the Second Amendment. \n",
