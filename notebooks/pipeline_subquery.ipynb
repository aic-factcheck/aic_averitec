Finance Minister Patrick Chinamasa promised in a budget speech last week to re-engage with international lenders, curb spending and attract investors to revive the economy. '}, page_content='The African Export and Import Bank has pledged up to $1.5 billion in new loans and financial guarantees to Zimbabwe in a major boost for new President Emmerson Mnangagwa\\'s government, the bank\\'s president and chairman said Tuesday. Mnangagwa, who took over last month after veteran autocrat Robert Mugabe quit following a de facto military coup, has vowed to focus on reviving the struggling economy and provide jobs in a nation with an unemployment rate exceeding 80 percent. Afreximbank was the only international lender that stood by Zimbabwe throughout Mugabe\\'s repressive 37-year rule, but its quick announcement of a fresh package of loans and guarantees appeared to be a vote of confidence in the new government. Cairo-based Afreximbank was a major funder of Zimbabwe while the country was cut off from the International Monetary Fund and World Bank for having defaulted on its debt in 1999. Bank president and chairman Okey Oramah told reporters after a meeting with Mnangagwa and senior government officials that Afreximbank would provide $150 million to local banks to help them pay for outstanding critical imports. \"We also discussed a number of other areas that involve additional investment from us for something that will be in the order of $1 billion to $1.5 billion that will include certain kinds of guarantees to encourage investors to come to Zimbabwe. \"We ... want to make sure that we support the stabilization of the economy, that means providing liquidity to make sure that the situation where people are rushing every time to look for cash is dealt with,\" Oramah said. In August, before Mugabe\\'s ouster, Afreximbank provided $600 million to help Zimbabwe pay for imports and $300 million to allow it to print more \"bond notes,\" a quasi-currency that officially trades on par with the U.S. dollar. Zimbabwe has a foreign debt of more than $7 billion and in September said it would not be able to pay $1.8 billion in arrears to the World Bank and African Development Bank until economic fundamentals improved.

Dr. Oramah, said at a ceremony where he received the title for land donated by the Government of Zimbabwe for the construction of the Bank’s permanent Regional Office for Southern Africa, that the complexes, to be branded “Afreximbank – Africa Trade Centres, would create mini business parks for African trade. They would offer such facilities as a large auditorium conference centre; a trade information centre; corporate rental office space for trade promoting bodies, export credit agencies, commercial banks, etc.; a small business innovation and incubation hub; upmarket furnished offices; high end shops and restaurants; and public facilities, including gymnasium, food court, etc. “I am pleased to note that Zimbabwe will be the first beneficiary of this concept,” he said. “The project, when completed, will transform Zimbabwe into an intra-African trade hub; a centre of knowledge and information about markets; and a centre where major deals can be struck.” The project will also accelerate the transformation of the neighbourhood into a business district and will enable Afreximbank to expand its operations in Southern Africa in size, scope and complexity, added the President. He commended Zimbabwe for its support to the Bank and for allocating the land measuring 12,000 square metres to it, saying that Afreximbank’s relationship with Zimbabwe dated back more than two decades and had grown into a “solid marriage” so strong that no crisis could put it asunder.

President Emmerson Mnangagwa’s government has promised to curb borrowing in 2019 under reforms to revive the southern African economy, after the budget deficit soared last year following a spike in spending ahead of elections. Finance Minister Mthuli Ncube told Reuters last week that the local RTGS dollar, Zimbabwe’s new de facto currency, will be backed up with fiscal discipline and the government would allow it to fluctuate but would manage excessive volatility. On the interbank forex market on Monday, one U.S. dollar fetched 2.5 RTGS dollars, the same rate as on Feb. 22 when the central bank sold some dollars to banks. That compares to a rate of 3.5 RTGS dollars per U.S. dollar on the black market.

The southern African nation last month ditched a discredited 1:1 dollar peg for its surrogate bond notes and electronic dollars, merging them into a lower-value transitional currency called the RTGS dollar. Mangudya said the central bank borrowed $641 million from the African Export and Import Bank, $152 million from Eastern and Southern African Trade and Development Bank, and $25 million from Mozambique’s central bank, among others. The loans, which would be repaid from future gold earnings, have a tenure of between three and five years and attract an interest of up to 6 percent above the Libor rate, Mangudya said. Gold is Zimbabwe’s single biggest mineral export earner, accounting for a third of its $4.2 billion earnings last year after a record output, central bank data shows. “These loans are well structured facilities contracted last year. They will be paid from future (gold) export receivables,” Mangudya told a parliamentary committee. The central bank takes 45 percent of dollar sales from gold producers and half from other miners to fund imports like fuel and power and repay foreign loans. But the miners only have 30 days to keep their dollar balances in local foreign currency accounts, after which they must sell them. The companies have asked the central bank to extend the period they may keep their dollars to 90 days, according to mining executives. Unable to get funding from foreign lenders like the International Monetary Fund and World Bank due to arrears of more than $2.4 billion, Zimbabwe has looked to financiers from the continent and local banks to shore up its budget. The central bank chief said Zimbabwe had just $500 million in reserves, enough to purchase four weeks’ worth of imports.

Afreximbank—a pan-African multilateral trade finance institution—has granted a three-year USD 250 Mn credit facility to the Southern African nation, Bloomberg Africa reports. This funding comes at a time when Zimbabwe looks assailed on all sides. From its diplomatic spat with the United States to the economic quagmire it is currently in and the uncertainty of the country’s progress in the face of Covid-19, there are many hopes that the country could outlive the multi-faceted crisis. Zimbabwe is one of the few African countries whose debt pile has made IMF turn a blind eye on lending money, even in the tough times of the coronavirus pandemic. Other African nations whose debts are not entirely unsustainable are unable to get loans from the IMF—plus the World Bank Group. Like Zambia—a neighboring African country whose debt problem has it in the Bretton Woods institution’s bad borrowing books—Zimbabwe isn’t among economies that have been earmarked as beneficiaries of the IMF’s half a billion dollars in packages. The country, which has become the poster child for hyperinflation, currency devaluation, and mobile money cataclysm in Africa, is currently grappling with USD 2.2 Bn debt. It owes this amount to international financial institutions, such as the World Bank and the African Development Bank (AfDB). Nevertheless, Harare, the nation’s capital, has cleared its outstanding position of USD 107.9 Mn with the IMF, as of October 2016. Technically, still, the Emmerson Mnangagwa-led nation remains ineligible to receive relief funds. Because multilateral lenders are a no-go, Zimbabwe resorted to other means to raise funds needed to battle the coronavirus pandemic’s economic effects. ', 'context_after': 'Nonetheless, the situation is yet to be rectified, as fingers are crossed against the government’s next step. In March 2019, the Afreximbank stepped in with a USD 1.5 Mn donation to support relief for another of Zimbabwe’s problems, a tropical cyclone known as Idai. The natural occurrence has, indeed, devastated not only Zimbabwe but also South Africa and Mozambique. Although much needed for similar crises, there remains no official statement regarding what the new USD 250 Mn facility would be used for. It is unclear how Zimbabwe accessed these funds, just as it isn’t common knowledge whether the Zimbabwe-Afreximbank relationship would be brought to question because of the nation’s debt problems. '}, page_content='For instance, it secured USD 200 Mn in treasury bill auctions in early June (2020). According to the country’s finance minister, Mthuli Ncube, the government aims to raise as much as ZW$ 1 Bn, as it will also source funds from insurance and pension funds. The Zimbabwe-Afreximbank seemingly quiet friendship is not entirely unheard of. In fact, there have been worries about the financial institution’s support for the country, since Zimbabwe is more or less on the economic blacklist of a couple of multilateral lenders. Before now, the nations used its minerals as collateral to secure money from the bank, a threat to future negotiations with foreign creditors to restructure its USD 8.8 Bn debt. Being unable to get funds from the IMF and the likes is a problem that has been around since 1999. So, for the past 5 years, Zimbabwe has been leaning on the financial shoulders of the African Export and Import Bank, which was created in 1993 under the auspices of the African Development Bank. Even with mineral-backed loans, the country yet faced repeated dollar crunches, leading to a shortage in everything from fuel to food and medics. The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe, the country’s apex bank, borrowed USD 985 Mn from African lenders in 2018, a year after which is secured USD 500 Mn from international banks whose names remain under wraps till now. According to speculations, the money came from the Afreximbank. That particular loan comprises USD 1 Mn in finance-bridging, while some of it was used to buy fuel and make token payments to South Africa and Mozambique for past electricity imports. It is no longer news that Zimbabwe’s economy could be at its worst ever. Presently, the country’s stock exchange, alongside mobile money platforms, has been ordered to close operations. The government’s opinion is that these two financial verticals are responsible for the hyperinflation and currency devaluation that is wreaking havoc on the country’s economy.

The whole thing was supposed to be done before Election Day and to get some famous faces to pull attention away from an entire country being sieged by the coronavirus pandemic.

Apparently, the only name that managed to get vetted and actually come through for the project was Dennis Quaid. And seeing as how no Dennis Quaid PSA has hit the internet just yet, it\\'s clear that the $300 million project was a waste of taxpayer money. The AV Club adds that any individuals who had ever been critical of Donald Trump or \"supported former President Barack Obama, gay rights, or same-sex marriage\" were automatically disqualified. The Post published the reasoning behind a few more exclusions: \"The same document indicates that singer-songwriter Christina Aguilera \\'is an Obama-supporting Democrat and a gay rights supporting liberal\\'; singer Adam Levine is a \\'liberal Democrat who supported Obama and fights for gay rights\\'; singer-songwriter Justin Timberlake \\'publicly endorsed Obama and supports gay marriage\\'; actor Johnny Depp \\'appears to be aligned with the liberal left\\'; and actor Jack Black is \\'known to be a classic Hollywood liberal.\\'\" '), Document(metadata={'url': 'https://medium.com/everythings-interesting/no-the-trump-administration-didnt-accuse-billie-eilish-of-destroying-our-country-3771ad9361b6', 'context_before': '', 'context_after': ''}, page_content='No, the Trump administration didn’t accuse Billie Eilish of “destroying our country” The dangers of aggregate journalism in the age of “fake news” Earlier today, news broke in the Washington Post that the Trump administration had been attempting to set up a $250 million PSA campaign to “inspire hope” amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, an attempt which now seems to have fallen apart. Leaked internal documents obtained by the Post show an exhaustive list of celebrities who were approached to participate in the ad campaign, and everyone from Miranda Cosgrove to Meryl Streep is included, making the list a fascinating look at who’s famous at this moment… as well as which demographics the Trump administration thought each celeb could help reach. It’s quite a silly read. They think Lin-Manuel Miranda is perfect for Asian-American outreach, for some reason — perhaps just racist assumptions based on his name rather than any idea of who he is as a person. They seem to have ruled Christina Aguilera out of consideration because she “is a gay-rights supporting liberal,” whereas Lady Gaga’s entry bizarrely says she “has not specifically claimed any political side.” It’s a pop culture-obsessive’s delight, seeing through the looking glass at what conservatives apparently think of celebrities — who tend, typically, to be on our side. Many entertainment news outlets, though, chose to cover this story by zeroing in on one particular spreadsheet entry — the one about music’s it-girl Billie Eilish. In particular, outlets from the AV Club to Billboard, from NME and Complex to LoveBScott, all wrote something along the lines of: “Leaked documents show the Trump administration thinks Billie Eilish is ‘destroying our country and everything we care about.’” That’d be funny… if it were true.

A peculiar amount of ire, per the Washington Post, was reserved for Grammy winner Billie Eilish. A document detailing the administration\\'s problems with an assortment of \"at least\" 274 artists and celebrities who were being considered for the public health campaign pointed out that Eilish is, in fact, \"not a Trump supporter.\" Furthermore, in the words of the document, the Trump team is convinced the 18-year-old megastar is \"destroying our country and everything we care about.\" Top-ranking Democrats recently penned a letter to Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar stating that documents from the campaign showed HHS Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Michael Caputo trying to use the taxpayer-funded effort as a way of helping the president and failed steak salesman\\'s image. Related: Billie Eilish: Trump is \\'destroying\\' the US Other figures who were under consideration but ultimately not approved for similar reasons include Jennifer Lopez, Judd Apatow, George Lopez, Christina Aguilera, Adam Levine, Justin Timberlake, Jack Black, and Johnny Depp. It\\'s worth noting that it appears the pricey public health ad, though said to have intentionally been intended to encourage optimism during the ongoing pandemic, quickly became more of an attempt to track down virtually apolitical celebrities and/or those who would somehow manage to make Trump look good.

A peculiar amount of ire, per the Washington Post, was reserved for Grammy winner Billie Eilish. A document detailing the administration\\'s problems with an assortment of \"at least\" 274 artists and celebrities who were being considered for the public health campaign pointed out that Eilish is, in fact, \"not a Trump supporter.\" Furthermore, in the words of the document, the Trump team is convinced the 18-year-old megastar is \"destroying our country and everything we care about.\" Top-ranking Democrats recently penned a letter to Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar stating that documents from the campaign showed HHS Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Michael Caputo trying to use the taxpayer-funded effort as a way of helping the president and failed steak salesman\\'s image. Related: Billie Eilish: Trump is \\'destroying\\' the US Other figures who were under consideration but ultimately not approved for similar reasons include Jennifer Lopez, Judd Apatow, George Lopez, Christina Aguilera, Adam Levine, Justin Timberlake, Jack Black, and Johnny Depp. It\\'s worth noting that it appears the pricey public health ad, though said to have intentionally been intended to encourage optimism during the ongoing pandemic, quickly became more of an attempt to track down virtually apolitical celebrities and/or those who would somehow manage to make Trump look good.

According to the Washington Post, documents pertaining to a pro-Trump public health campaign vetted various celebrities who could be involved. The stars were removed from consideration if they had ever criticised the president, supported former President Barack Obama or advocated for same-sex marriage and gay rights, according to documents obtained by Democratic House Lawmakers. A note on pop star Billie Eilish stated that she should not appear in the US$250 million ad campaign because she was \"not a Trump supporter,\" and in fact, was \"destroying our country and everything we care about\". The phrasing of the last point exactly mimics what Eilish said about Trump when she appeared in a video during the Democratic Convention earlier this year, where she also endorsed Joe Biden for president. The Washington Post reports that a PSA Celebrity Tracker documented flagged many other celebrities for their stances on political and social issues, including Christina Aguilera, dubbed an \"Obama-supporting Democrat\" and \"gay rights supporting liberal\", and Jack Black, \"known to be a classic Hollywood liberal\". Justin Timberlake, Selena Gomez, Jennifer Lopez, Judd Apatow and Brad Pitt were also all noted to have exhibited anti-Trump or liberal Democrat behaviours. The Trump administration reportedly only approved 10 celebrities out of the approximately 247 considered to spread the message of \"helping the president help the country,\" the theme suggested by Trump’s Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs. Dennis Quaid, Billy Ray Cyrus and Enrique Iglesias were among those who got the green light. Three stars reportedly sat for interviews about the pandemic, but later withdrew their consent for the footage to be used.
