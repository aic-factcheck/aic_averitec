The high court also asks the Commission Elections (Comelec) to preserve election returns (ERs) that are subject to protest through a Precautionary Protection Order (PPO). The Marcos camp files a three-page letter-manifestation questioning the Comelec’s decision to issue a resolution approving the stripping of the vote-counting machines (VCMs) and laptops used in the May 9 polls, despite the PPO from PET. The stripping activity involves the backup of data from the automated election system so that Comelec can return the leased equipment to the service provider, Smartmatic International.

The Comelec starts returning over 1,000 VCMs to its supplier despite opposition from Marcos, whose poll protest was based partly on allegations that the election results had been manipulated with the use of VCMs. Marcos appeals to PET to furnish them with the results of the decryption of the supposedly “unused” SD (secured digital) cards found to have data during the stripping process.

On May 27, 2016, Robredo was declared the winner after the closing of the canvassing of 166 certificates of canvass (COCs). Based on the official count of Congress sitting as the National Board of Canvassers, she garnered a total of 14,418,817 votes. Meanwhile, Marcos finishes second with 14, 155,344 votes.

Marcos asks the Supreme Court (SC) sitting as PET to set aside Robredo’s proclamation as vice president. He submits a 1,000-page petition that urges the PET to declare him as the Philippines’ duly elected and rightful vice president. Aside from the petition, he also presents 20,000 pages of affidavits, certificates of canvass (COCs), and other supporting documents. According to him, the votes for Robredo were “products of electoral frauds, anomalies, and irregularities.” Meanwhile, his votes “were significantly reduced, manipulated and altered” to make it appear that he placed behind Robredo in the race. Marcos challenges the results in 132,446 established polling precincts in 27 cities and provinces, covering 39,221 clustered precincts. He likewise asks to annul the election results in Basilan, Maguindanao, and Lanao del Sur, which he claims the poll fraud occurred.

Along with her husband, she was instrumental in creating strong cooperation between local government and civil society in her hometown through the creation of a local people’s council, according to Ramon Casiple, executive director of the Quezon City-based Institute for Political and Electoral Reform. “This brought Naga from a fifth-class city to a first-class city,” explained Casiple. But Robredo’s focus will now shift to Manila, where she will be dealing with the country’s new president: the tough-talking former mayor of Davao City, Rodrigo Duterte, who ran for the PDP-Laban party and secured a commanding six-million vote margin over the Liberal Party’s Manuel Roxas. Although Duterte and Robredo are both from regions far from the capital and have experience in local politics, there is potential for clashes. “The issue of human rights might divide them. Leni Robredo had a career as a defender of human rights, and Duterte is well known for his contempt for the human rights of criminals,” said The Asia Foundation’s Steven Rood. Moreover, Robredo only beat her vice-presidential rival, Ferdinand Marcos Jr, son of former dictator Ferdinand Marcos, by a narrow margin of 260,000 votes. Duterte recently declared he is a political ally of the Marcos family, which could leave Robredo sidelined. Furthermore, she is closely linked to the outgoing president, Benigno Aquino III, and his protégé for the vice-presidency, Mar Roxas – both Liberal Party stalwarts. Robredo has said she will support Duterte “100%” but, as Thompson explained, many of her supporters are hoping Robredo will prove a moderate counterpoint during his term in office. “The vice-presidency, while treated by many as a spare-tyre position, can be a powerful and influential one,” said Go.

A middle-aged woman stands on a nondescript Metro Manila street at night-time, her back to the camera, dressed in faded jeans and a striped top, waiting for a bus. But Leni Robredo, the woman in the picture, is now vice-president of the Philippines. After being taken and going viral on social media in early December, in the midst of the vice-presidential race, the image did much to cement the impression of a down-to-earth contender in the public’s eye. Until being elected to Congress as a member of the Liberal Party in 2013, Robredo lived most of her life in her hometown of Naga City in the Bicol region, southeast of Manila. Being a new face in politics, along with her distance from “well-entrenched” politicians, could work well for her, said Jan Robert R. Go, assistant professor in the Department of Political Science at the University of the Philippines Diliman. “She knows how people live and how life actually is, especially that national politics in the Philippines is dominated by Metro Manila interests,” Go said. But her appeal does not end there. She has some of what Mark Thompson, director of the Southeast Asia Research Centre at Hong Kong’s City University, calls “inherited charisma”. This was acquired from her late husband, popular statesman Jesse Robredo, who died in a 2012 plane crash. Many Filipinos see parallels with the late Corazon ‘Cory’ Aquino, who became president after the assassination of her husband and the overthrow of the Ferdinand Marcos dictatorship. “[In the election, Robredo] had the image of an honest female leader that distinguished her from the male Machiavellians who largely make up the Philippine political landscape,” said Thompson. And, although she has a limited track record in government that could be considered a weakness, “like Cory Aquino it was also a strength as she seemed to be unsullied by traditional politics”, Thompson added.

Through using a relatively basic color coded theme tool, you can see who the most popular presidential and vice presidential candidates were by region. You also have the ability to plot and track on the map the amount of votes for each candidate by province/region, as well as the vote share/percentage in a way that is accessible and simple for your average voter to view and understand at a glance. With the ability to see which candidates were popular with voters in a particular region, we can gather and analyze useful data and make correlations as to why a specific candidate is popular in a certain areas, and much less popular in others. With a quick look at the simple map of the Philippines presidential election results, we can easily deduct that; - Rodrigo Duterte (Key - Red) was very popular in the capital region of Metro Manila and the instant surrounding areas and provinces. He was also extremely popular and gathered the most votes in the significant areas of the Visayas - Cebu, Bohol and Leyte. Duterte was also very popular in the majority of the whole region of Mindanao, where he served as the mayor of Davao for 22 years. He is also the only candidate who had significant support from all 3 key demographic regions of the Philippines - Luzon, The Visayas and Mindanao.

With a quick look at the simple map of the Philippines vice-presidential election results, we can easily deduct that; - Alan Peter Cayetano (Key Red) had significant parts of support in certain areas of the Mindanao region. This could be due to his association with Rodrigo Duterte - Being his running mate. Cayetano seems to have minimal support in any of the other areas or regions outside of Mindanao. - Francis Escuedero (Key Green) seems to have minimal support anywhere other than in small pockets of the Albay/Bicol region. - Gregorio Honasan (Key Orange) appears to have hardly any support from voters at all, with no pockets of orange to be seen anywhere on the map. - Ferdinand Marcos (Key Blue) appears to have a lot of support from most of the Luzon region including the capital city area of Metro Manila. The map shows that Marcos also seems to have a reasonable amount of support in spaced out pockets of The Visayas, and significant pockets of the Mindanao region. - Leni Robredo (Key Yellow) has a huge amount of support through nearly the whole of The Visayas Region as well as significant parts of the Mindanao Region.

She said the Marcos camp wrote the Comelec earlier that day asking about the new script. In the meantime, she said, the Marcos camp would wait for the official canvassing results while it continued to call for a stop to the PPCRV quick count. Citing the automated election law, Guanzon said the PPCRV was mandated to inform the public on the conduct of elections. “Under the law, quick count is allowed. There is no prohibition,” she said. “We have to be transparent to the people about the status of the voting. If we will conceal it, then many would have doubts. They might say there’s ‘magic’ involved.” In a separate interview, Comelec Chair Andres Bautista said the poll body had yet to receive a formal request from the Marcos camp. “Maybe it’s better if they send it to Congress where the official canvassing of votes for President and Vice President will be held. Comelec only canvasses votes for senators and party-list groups,” Bautista said. He challenged anyone with a complaint about the quick count to present evidence. “We are committed to being neutral. We are committing to count the votes as they come,” he said. At a press briefing, Robredo’s new spokesperson, Georgina Hernandez, lamented what she described as an attempt by the Marcos camp to condition the minds of the public about election rigging when the senator had no evidence to substantiate his claims. “The rise of Congresswoman Leni’s rating is due to the sweat and hard work of her supporters and volunteers.

His running mate, Allan Peter Cayetano, has given up the fight. But the fight continues for Leni Robredo and Ferdinand Marcos Jr. Robredo’s number spiked when the Mindanao votes started to come in. She got a greater number of votes from the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) at 408,397 compared to the 249,963 that Marcos garnered, based on the partial, unofficial 72.35 percent processed election returns. Both ARMM gubernatorial candidates– reelectionist Mujiv Hataman and Sulu vice governor Abdusakur Tan –belong to the pro-administration Liberal Party. They may have failed to deliver votes for the party’s standard bearer Mar Roxas as Duterte won by a wide margin in the region, but Robredo benefited from the LP machinery. Some analysts say Marcos had a dismal showing in the ARMM because of his family name. His namesake and father was the dictator blamed for starting the war in the region in the 1970s. It was during President Marcos’ administration that the Moro National Liberation Front was founded. It was also during this era that Muslims fell victims to human rights violations perpetrated by state security forces. The people’s experience under Martial Law may have also boosted Robredo’s numbers in the Caraga Region, where she got more than 120,000 votes against the dictator’s son, and in Northern Mindanao, where she garnered 680,148 votes, compared to Marcos’ 427,116. But in Central Mindanao, Marcos edged Robredo with at least 80,000 votes. It is only in Southern Mindanao where Cayetano became the frontrunner– garnering more than a million votes, more than half of Marcos’ 461,386 and Robredo’s 230,468 (94.74 percent partial, unofficial). Southern Mindanao is considered to be Duterte’s bailiwick. Even with Marcos getting more votes in Central and Southern Mindanao, these were not enough to overtake Robredo’s numbers.

In the 2016 congressional elections, no single party won an outright majority in either house, but President Duterte’s PDP-Laban Party secured unprecedented majority alliances in both chambers. While open and competitive, elections in the Philippines are typically marred by fraud, intimidation, and political violence. The 2016 national elections were credible, and while they were marked by dozens of incidents of election-related violence, including a number of killings, there were fewer such incidents compared to previous election years. Other persistent problems included media bias, which tends to favor wealthier candidates, and vote buying, offers for which affected nearly 20 percent of voters in 2016, according to one survey.

Many are saying that the opposition is silent but it is very much alive,” she said. For his part, former president Aquino called on voters to look not on the popularity but the good and clean track record of the opposition candidates. “We’re showing eight individuals whom we can be proud of, who have dreams for our country,” he said. Hilbay, who served as solicitor general under the previous administration, led the Philippines’ case against China before the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague over disputed territories in the West Philippine Sea.

'}, page_content='Benigno Aquino III, Leni Robredo endorse opposition Senate 12 MANILA, Philippines — Betting on their good and clean track record, Vice President Leni Robredo yesterday expressed confidence in the victory of candidates of the opposition coalition in the May 2019 senatorial elections. Robredo, who chairs the Liberal Party, led the presentation of the Oposisyon Koalisyon (OK) slate in Barangay Parang, Marikina City. The opposition candidates include former senator Mar Roxas, former Quezon congressman Erin Tañada, Maranao advocate Samira Gutoc-Tomawis, Magdalo Rep. Gary Alejano, human rights lawyer Jose Manuel “Chel” Diokno, election lawyer Romulo Macalintal, incumbent Sen. Paolo Benigno “Bam” Aquino IV and former solicitor general Florin Hilbay. Of the eight candidates, only Aquino, Tañada and Roxas belong to LP. Roxas was not able to attend the event because he is abroad, according to Aquino. “The eight candidates whom we will field come from different backgrounds but their capabilities are beyond question,” the Vice President said in a speech delivered in Filipino. Robredo admitted that these candidates are not as popular as some others, but she believes they will win as long as the public would unite for them, relating her own experience in the 2016 national election. “Many are saying that this will be a tough fight for them. But I think I’m the best example. Many have said that I didn’t have the chance (to win the vice presidency). But because the people united for me, the one percent to vice president became possible,” she said, referring to her initial ratings in surveys prior to the May 2016 polls. Apart from Robredo, former president Benigno Aquino III, Sen. Antonio Trillanes IV, Sen. Risa Hontiveros, Albay Rep. Edcel Lagman and Marikina Rep. Miro Quimbo also attended the event. Robredo said the opposition remains “very alive” despite being supposedly threatened by the present administration. ')], metadata=None)"

At those plants alone, almost 1,500 workers have been infected and at least 12 have died, but the fines totaled just $29,000—an amount criticized as far too lenient by experts, former government officials, and worker advocates alike. This meager penalty underscores that, during the first six months of the pandemic, in no community have the foundational inequities in U.S. society become more visible than among poultry and meatpacking workers. They are the most impacted group of workers in the United States, but under the current federal health and safety enforcement regime, perhaps the least protected. One of the most dangerous and exploitative industries in the country, the slaughter and processing of the meat we eat relies heavily upon rural workers—disproportionately immigrants, refugees, and people of color—who have few better options. According to the Food and Environment Reporting Network (FERN), which has tracked the spread of the coronavirus in this industry since April, as of September 22 at least 42,708 people in 496 meat and poultry plants have been infected with COVID-19, and at least 203 have died. These figures and the lives they represent highlight how race, ethnicity, citizenship, and class status intersect to shape individual and collective life chances. They also illustrate the ways in which population health outcomes are shaped by labor policies and practices. As the media work to highlight the impact of COVID-19 among meat and poultry workers, reporters have sought reliable data to deepen our understanding of this industry. Their first and most basic question: Who are the people who labor in this node of America’s food chain? What is the racial and ethnic composition of the workforce? Where are they from? Which languages do they speak? \\nSome of the existing ethnographic data—including from our own research—provides vital insight into the rich textures of workers’ lives on the line and at home, but unfortunately often can’t answer these questions at the macro level. Here, we set out to explore how existing demographic data—most of which comes from government surveys—might help provide a broader scaffolding for answering these questions on a national scale and by state. While data from the U.S. Census Bureau continues to be the best source of demographic data available, some of what we found was not consistent with what we have learned in ethnographic research about the profiles of meat and poultry workers. This blog post explains why that might be the case and urges caution, particularly when relying on state-level breakdowns of those data. The U.S. Department of Labor’s Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW), which is based on data reported directly by employers to unemployment insurance agencies, provides the best available estimate of the total number of workers nationwide in animal slaughtering and processing by state. It reports the five-year average, as of 2018, as 498,848 people (230,733 in poultry and 268,115 in red meat). The QCEW estimates shown in Table 1 list the top five meatpacking and poultry states, by number of workers, and serve to corroborate what is widely known—that the poultry industry has flourished in the states of the Deep South, while meatpacking is concentrated principally in the Midwest and Plains states.1 Top five meatpacking and poultry processing states, by number of workers Notes: Figures represent the five-year average of workers reported by firms, by industrial sector in each state from January 2014 through December 2018. Beef and hog slaughtering firms are identified by the following North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes: 311611 – Animal Slaughtering, Except Poultry; 311612 – '), Evidence(question='How many COVID-19 cases have been reported among health care workers?', answer='As of June 25, United Food and Commercial Workers International Union reported that 238 of its members in the grocery, meatpacking, food processing, and health care industries had died from COVID-19 and about 29,000 had been infected or exposed.', url='https://www.thenationshealth.org/content/50/6/1.1', scraped_text='Coordinated work against COVID-19 between health officials in northern Utah and a local meatpacking plant began in early March — before any confirmed cases in the area. By the end of May, at least 287 of the plant’s employees had been infected. “But we believe the actual number of cases linked to the facility is likely higher,” Josh Greer, public information officer at Bear River Health Department in Logan, Utah, told The Nation’s Health in June. “Trying to trace each case is becoming less and less realistic.” Typical working conditions inside meatpacking plants make the perfect setting for coronavirus spread. Employees work close together; they breathe heavily while doing physically intense, high-speed labor, which makes it harder to consistently wear face coverings; the plants are cold, which may affect how well the virus survives; and workers often lack access to paid sick leave. Nationwide, as of late June, infections tied to meatpacking facilities had climbed to nearly 28,000 cases and 100 deaths across 250 plants, according to the Food and Environment Reporting Network, which is mapping COVID-19 outbreaks in the food system. Greer said health staff worked closely with the JBS beef plant in Hyrum, Utah, as it readied for COVID-19. He said the plant reported a number of preventive measures, such as temperature screenings, face shields, increased sanitation and plastic dividers between workers on the processing line to keep people safe. But none of it kept the virus away. Near the end of May, local COVID-19 case numbers suddenly rose, prompting a mass testing event at the Hyrum plant. Of the almost 1,000 workers screened, about a third were positive. Without enough resources to contain the outbreak on its own, Greer said the Bear River Health Department quickly recruited staff from other local health agencies to help with disease investigation and tracing. \\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also stationed a team at the health department. But the challenges are steep, Greer said in June, and the caseload is overwhelming. “This has been an experience like none other,” he said. Across the U.S., fewer than one-third of workers can do their jobs from home, putting the rest of the labor force at higher risk of COVID-19 and underscoring the critical role of workplace safety in preventing spread. There is no way to know exactly how many U.S. COVID-19 infections are due to workplace exposures, though some sectors — such as health care, food processing, meatpacking, agriculture, public transit, retail and sanitation — face higher risks and are hotspots for infection. On June 25, United Food and Commercial Workers International Union reported that 238 of its members — workers in the grocery, meatpacking, food processing and health care industries — had died from COVID-19 and about 29,000 had been infected or exposed in the pandemic’s first 100 days. In response, the union called for reinstating hazard pay in all states where COVID-19 is rising, mandating masks in public and creating a national registry where all employers with more than 1,000 workers have to regularly release data on COVID-19 illnesses, deaths and exposures. Despite pleas from APHA and other advocates, the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration had failed to issue an emergency safety standard for COVID-19 as of early July, relegating worker safety to a patchwork of state systems and voluntary guidance. A June report from the Department of Labor’s Office of Inspector General found that “unless proper precautions are taken, avoidable COVID-19 infections and deaths may occur” as more people return to work. \\n“In many ways, workplace exposures have become the fulcrum of the epidemic,” said APHA member David Michaels, PhD, MPH, who served as OSHA’s longest-serving administrator from 2009 to 2017 and is now a professor at the George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health. There is no existing OSHA rule that comprehensively addresses an employer’s duty to protect workers from airborne infectious disease. The agency has issued guidance for employers — such as it did for meatpacking plants in April — but the recommendations are not mandatory. And while an emergency OSHA rule would not eliminate COVID-19 risks, Michaels said it could still make a difference, despite OSHA’s severely limited enforcement resources. “If OSHA moved quickly and issued some high-profile, high-penalty citations, that would send a very strong message to employers,” Michaels said, citing a recent study that found one OSHA news release about violations yielded compliance equal to more than 200 inspections. In May, AFL-CIO sued OSHA to compel it to issue a temporary emergency COVID-19 rule that would require employers to develop COVID-19 safety plans. A court ruled against the union in June, and it promptly filed for a rehearing, said APHA member Rebecca Reindel, MPH, MS, director of occupational safety and health at AFL-CIO. Many essential workers who face the highest COVID-19 risks also have the fewest labor protections and face the biggest barriers to speaking up about safety, Reindel said.

Of industries that also have a rural manufacturing-dependent county, only animal  slaughtering and processing and seafood product preparation and packaging were significant outliers, with meatpacking having significantly higher total employment.   COVID-19 Working Paper: Meatpacking Working Conditions and the Spread of COVID-19, AP-092  Table 1 and figure 2 provide strong evidence that the outbreaks within the meatpacking industry can  likely be attributed to workers' uniquely high physical proximity. They also raise the possibility that meatpacking might be more susceptible to disease and virus outbreaks generally. However, further work should aim at distinguishing the possible contributions from foodborne and airborne illnesses. While other characteristics, such as low temperatures or a loud work environment could lead to higher rates of COVID-19 spread, neither factor was found to significantly vary between meatpacking and other  manufacturing industries. In the case of a loud work environment, which may increase the spread of the disease due to increased particle admission when having to shout, meatpacking was below the sample  Supplementing these results are the findings from Taylor et al. (2020) that meatpacking companies that had received a waiver to increase production speeds saw increased rates of COVID-19 compared with  plants that received no such waiver. Plants with higher line speeds (i.e., faster equipment) likely also necessarily increased physical proximity between their workers. Günther et al. (2020) documented the spread of COVID-19 at a single large meatpacking plant, highlighting the importance of physical  proximity in the spread of the disease. They found evidence that cases that spread within the plant had a significant spatial pattern. Specifically, there was significant transmission of COVID-19 to co-workers working within close physical proximity. Using information collected on living conditions and  \\ntransportation of individuals at this meatpacking plant, their data also strongly suggested that while there may have been secondary infections outside of work, transmission most likely occurred at the processing plant. Extrapolating their findings to our results, inference that many of the cases observed in our meatpacking-dependent counties occurred via close physical proximity to workers with COVID-19 and  likely not through secondary infections from outside the processing plant.   Further complementing our results is an additional report from the CDC, which evaluated a single  meatpacking plant in South Dakota (Steinberg et al., 2020). This report found frontline workers, who often work in close proximity to one another, had higher case rates of COVID-19 compared with other  workers. Furthermore, salaried workers who had individual workstations (thus enabling them to increase physical distance and implement physical barriers) experienced lower rates relative to hourly workers with less access to such amenities. While the CDC focused on a single meatpacking plant, it provides anecdotal context supporting our findings. Since industry-specific data was analyzed, our results are likely valid for the entire industry at large in that the physical proximity of workers was a primary driver of the COVID-19 outbreaks experienced across meatpacking.

Meatpacking plants are cold, have many metal surfaces, and are often loud, forcing workers to raise their voices to be heard and contributing to the spread of Covid. Meatpacking plants, nursing homes, and prisons were three hotspots for Covid-19. About three-fourths of meatpacking workers are represented by unions, which called on meatpackers to slow line speeds so that workers could be spaced further apart. Some workers staged protests, alleging that the plants placed employees too close together to prevent the spread of the virus. The United Food and Commercial Workers union, which represents 250,000 meatpacking workers, reported that 15,700 meatpacking workers contracted Covid-19 by July 2020, and 76 died. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in July 2020 released a report on 16,000 Covid-19 cases at 239 meatpacking plants in 21 states that found that 87 percent of meatpacking workers infected were racial or ethnic minorities; these minorities were 61 percent of workers. White non-Hispanics are 39 percent of meatpacking workers, and they accounted for 13 percent of Covid-19 cases. The share of workers infected varied from three to 24 percent across plants. The US has 800 federally inspected slaughterhouses, but the largest 50 account for most US meat production, including 15 that process 60 percent of US pork. Most of the plants owned by Tyson Foods, JBS USA and Smithfield Foods have over 500 employees and are not required to offer paid sick leave. Nonetheless, some began to offer paid sick leave, and some offered bonuses of up to $500 a month to employees who did not miss any work. \\nTyson, JBS and Smithfield closed 15 plants in April 2020, reducing the US pork supply by a quarter. Tyson closed its largest pork plant in Waterloo, Iowa after almost 30 percent of the 2,700 employees tested positive for Covid-19, and closed another plant in Storm Lake, Iowa after a quarter of the 2,300 workers tested positive. Smithfield Foods closed its 3,700 employee Sioux Falls, South Dakota plant that processes 19,500 hogs a day after over 500 workers tested positive; 30 percent of Covid-19 cases in South Dakota are linked to meatpacking plants. Smithfield, which employs 40,000 workers in the US, was bought by China?s WH Group Ltd in 2013 for $4.7 billion. South Dakota was one of five US states that did not issue stay at home orders during the pandemic. President Trump in April 2020 signed an executive order that deemed meatpacking plants to be ?critical infrastructure,? making federal authorities responsible for worker safety in meatpacking plants and barring suits from workers who contract Covid-19 at work. Unions asked meat processors to test all workers before reopening closed plants. Trump?s order allowed the plants to reopen without testing workers. Meatpackers and many other US employers required workers returning to work to sign liability waivers, promising not to sue if they contracted Covid-19 at work. In some states, essential workers who contract Covid-19 are assumed to have contracted the disease at work, making it easier to obtain workers compensation benefits. Many service firms such as gyms and parks required their customers to sign liability waivers. Most meatpacking plants reopened after deep cleanings at slower line speeds. As a result, there were too many hogs for meatpackers to process, and hundreds of thousands were gassed. Piglets become market-ready after six months, when they weigh about 300 pounds. Large hog farms are constantly raising new piglets, so they have little extra space to hold market-ready hogs that cannot be processed.

He said the plant reported a number of preventive measures, such as temperature screenings, face shields, increased sanitation and plastic dividers between workers on the processing line to keep people safe. But none of it kept the virus away. Near the end of May, local COVID-19 case numbers suddenly rose, prompting a mass testing event at the Hyrum plant.

In response, the union called for reinstating hazard pay in all states where COVID-19 is rising, mandating masks in public and creating a national registry where all employers with more than 1,000 workers have to regularly release data on COVID-19 illnesses, deaths and exposures. Despite pleas from APHA and other advocates, the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration had failed to issue an emergency safety standard for COVID-19 as of early July, relegating worker safety to a patchwork of state systems and voluntary guidance.

COVID-19 Working Paper: Meatpacking Working Conditions and the Spread of COVID-19, AP-092  Table 1 and figure 2 provide strong evidence that the outbreaks within the meatpacking industry can  likely be attributed to workers' uniquely high physical proximity. They also raise the possibility that meatpacking might be more susceptible to disease and virus outbreaks generally. However, further work should aim at distinguishing the possible contributions from foodborne and airborne illnesses. While other characteristics, such as low temperatures or a loud work environment could lead to higher rates of COVID-19 spread, neither factor was found to significantly vary between meatpacking and other  manufacturing industries. In the case of a loud work environment, which may increase the spread of the disease due to increased particle admission when having to shout, meatpacking was below the sample  Supplementing these results are the findings from Taylor et al. (2020) that meatpacking companies that had received a waiver to increase production speeds saw increased rates of COVID-19 compared with  plants that received no such waiver. Plants with higher line speeds (i.e., faster equipment) likely also necessarily increased physical proximity between their workers. Günther et al. (2020) documented the spread of COVID-19 at a single large meatpacking plant, highlighting the importance of physical  proximity in the spread of the disease. They found evidence that cases that spread within the plant had a significant spatial pattern.

Greater than 1 means that meatpacking is higher than manufacturing, while a value of less than 1 signifies that meatpacking is lower than manufacturing.  24 Appendix B tracks the data as separate categories rather than presenting the ratio.   COVID-19 Working Paper: Meatpacking Working Conditions and the Spread of COVID-19, AP-092  At this time, cases began to climb substantially within rural meatpacking-dependent counties relative to all other rural manufacturing-dependent counties. The peak of this disparity occurred in early May 2020, with meatpacking-dependent counties having nearly 10 times as many cases per day, compared with the  other counties in our study.25 During the next 2 months, there was a significant drop until early July 2020, at which point both groups of counties experienced almost identical caseloads for the remainder of our data frame. It should be noted that there was an increase in COVID-19 cases in other manufacturing- dependent counties during May and June 2020; however, the growth was substantially smaller than the  decrease in daily cases in meatpacking-dependent counties during the end of May through June 2020.26 Therefore, figure 3 provides suggestive evidence that there was some change within these meatpacking- dependent counties driving this drop, rather than being driven by an increase in cases from the other \"}, page_content='transportation of individuals at this meatpacking plant, their data also strongly suggested that while there may have been secondary infections outside of work, transmission most likely occurred at the processing plant. Extrapolating their findings to our results, inference that many of the cases observed in our meatpacking-dependent counties occurred via close physical proximity to workers with COVID-19 and  likely not through secondary infections from outside the processing plant.   Further complementing our results is an additional report from the CDC, which evaluated a single  meatpacking plant in South Dakota (Steinberg et al., 2020). This report found frontline workers, who often work in close proximity to one another, had higher case rates of COVID-19 compared with other  workers. Furthermore, salaried workers who had individual workstations (thus enabling them to increase physical distance and implement physical barriers) experienced lower rates relative to hourly workers with less access to such amenities. While the CDC focused on a single meatpacking plant, it provides anecdotal context supporting our findings. Since industry-specific data was analyzed, our results are likely valid for the entire industry at large in that the physical proximity of workers was a primary driver of the COVID-19 outbreaks experienced across meatpacking.

Companies like Tyson, Pilgrim’s, Cargill, JBS and Smithfield are some of the worst offenders. According to a Human Rights Watch analysis of federal workplace injury data between 2015 and 2018, Tyson Foods ranks fifth out of all companies, while Pilgrim’s Pride, Cargill, JBS, and Smithfield all ranked within the top 30. This is despite meat and poultry companies having significantly smaller workforces than other companies on the list, such as UPS and Walmart. I’ve also heard directly from farmworkers about the egregious conditions they are working under and, frankly, the gross negligence of the employers who are forcing them to work under these conditions. Some workers told me their hands bleed from tying plants. Some told me they have to choose between taking their kids to the fields where there are toxins and pesticides or leaving them home alone. They endure all of this while barely being able to make ends meet, working twice as hard to feed their families. It is unconscionable that the very people we depend on to help deliver a safe and abundant supply of food are themselves subject to unacceptably lax safety standards and dangerous work environments riddled with wholly preventable safety hazards. Workplace injuries are commonplace in these industries. Moving machine parts and the tools of the trade, such as knives, saws, hooks, and scissors can cause serious cuts, broken bones, concussions, and amputations. Chemicals used for disinfecting and storage like ammonia and liquid nitrogen can lead to chemical burns, eye and lung injuries, and asphyxiation. And the repetitive, forceful motions that workers perform at breakneck speed can over time cause traumatic and debilitating injuries.

According to data from the US Department of Agriculture, shipments of American pork to China more than quadrupled since March when the pandemic began. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) is the agency responsible for promoting the health and safety of these workers. But throughout most of this pandemic, OSHA has been largely asleep at the wheel, allowing meatpacking and agricultural facilities to become deadly COVID-19 hotspots and failing to hold companies accountable. Under the leadership of the previous administration, OSHA waited six months to take any action to protect meatpacking and agricultural workers from the spread of COVID-19. Any action they did take amounted to nothing more than a light slap on the wrist to big corporate meat, poultry and agricultural interests. In September, OSHA issued two small financial penalties totaling $29,000 to a Smithfield and a JBS plant. For context, in 2019, JBS’ annual revenue was $51.7 billion and Smithfield’s was $14 billion. This is all the more reason why urgent action is needed for OSHA to hold these industries accountable and protect meat, poultry, and farm workers from COVID-19. In Fiscal Year 2022, what we need to do is to prioritize additional resources to OSHA to increase inspections on the ground to protect workers in the most dangerous workplaces. We should place emphasis workplaces where workers are deemed essential and also face a higher risk of infection, such as slaughterhouses, poultry processing plants, and agricultural workplaces. In the interim, I am working with Chairman Bobby Scott to secure $150 million for worker protection activities at the Department of Labor as part of President Biden’s American Rescue Plan. '}, page_content='As Upton Sinclair wrote in The Jungle, and I quote, “This is no fairy tale and no joke.” Unfortunately, with the advent of COVID-19, the conditions facing workers in meat and poultry plants as well as farmworkers has only grown worse. According to data from the Food & Environment Reporting Network, to date there have been at least 1,782 COVID-19 outbreaks at meatpacking and food processing plants and farms to date. At least almost 88 thousand workers have tested positive for COVID-19 and at least 375 have died. Many meatpacking and agricultural companies have blatantly put profits over people, and few are being held to account. A study of California workers by occupational sector found that food and agriculture workers have experienced the highest “excess mortality” during the COVID-19 pandemic, with a 39% increase in mortality compared to past years. In other words, as Debbie Berkowitz will explain more in her testimony, more workers have died from COVID-19 in meat and poultry plants to date during the pandemic than died from all causes in the industry in the past 15 years. Instead of implementing commonsense social distancing strategies to prevent the spread of COVID-19, meat, poultry, and agricultural companies continued to pursue faster production practices, such as accelerated line speeds, to protect their bottom lines. Stunningly, during the first few months of the pandemic, over a dozen poultry plants, including Tyson, were given permission from the USDA (in the form of waivers from existing regulations) to actually increase their production line speeds, making it impossible to move workers further apart. Tyson then had the audacity to take out a full page ad in The Washington Post in April 2020, trumpeting their ineffective half-measures for worker health while placing the highest priority on the company’s meat processing productivity. I have a copy of that ad right here to put into the record.

The space between workers, who stand close together on production lines as they make the same cut over and over, was probably the main factor that caused the outbreaks, according to the USDA’s report published last month. Overall, meatpacking plant workers were much more likely to be exposed to the virus than workers in other manufacturing jobs. “It is a strong possibility that specifically the physical proximity of the workers in meatpacking plants is directly linked to the outbreaks that we saw in the spring and summer of 2020,” said Thomas Krumel, one of the paper’s authors and now an assistant professor at North Dakota State University. The paper, according to the researchers, could be the first effort to empirically identify conditions that caused coronavirus outbreaks in meatpacking plants at an industry-wide level. The paper’s conclusions support what many meatpacking workers and advocates suspected during the early months of the pandemic: Working close together and high speeds of production, which lead to an even more compact workplace, contributed to the virus’ spread. “Workers at the beginning of the pandemic identified immediately they were at higher risk of getting COVID than other workers because of the closeness,” said Magaly Licolli, executive director of Venceremos, a worker-based organization in Arkansas that advocates for poultry workers. “You know, in some departments, they work shoulder-to-shoulder.” Investigate Midwest reached out to the North American Meat Institute to get the industry’s take on the new study, but it did not immediately provide a statement. In the past, the lobbying group has argued rates of infection among meatpacking plant workers were below rates of infection for the general population. ', 'context_after': 'Meatpacking facilities were already “incredibly vulnerable” to COVID-19 outbreaks, according to the paper, because of consolidation within the industry resulting in large processing plants with hundreds and sometimes thousands of workers. “This was further exacerbated by the close physical proximity of workers within these plants, which helped to facilitate the disease’s spread—especially among frontline workers,” the report said. [Read more: ‘They think workers are like dogs.’ How pork plant execs sacrificed safety for profits.] Meatpacking companies including JBS and Smithfield have argued in court that they’re not liable for employees getting sick, and court decisions favoring workers are rare. The analysis’ authors theorized that, based on what’s happened during the COVID-19 pandemic, meatpacking plants in general might be more susceptible to disease and other viral outbreaks. The analysis, however, suggests that other factors such as low temperatures and a loud work environment — in which people may have to shout — had less of an impact on the overall spread of the coronavirus in meatpacking plants and did not vary significantly between other manufacturing industries. Plants with line speed waivers had larger outbreaks A study cited in the working paper found that poultry processing plants that received waivers allowing them to raise line speeds beyond federal limits saw more COVID-19 cases compared to facilities that didn’t get waivers. “Firms that have higher line speeds necessarily needed to have workers in closer physical proximity as a result of the increased line speeds,” Krumel said. “The increased line speeds likely resulted in workers being closer to each other.” [Read more: USDA let poultry plants put workers close together even as they got sick from coronavirus.] Line speeds played a role in a 2020 lawsuit against Smithfield when workers at the company’s Milan, Missouri, pork processing plant sued over a lack of coronavirus safety measures. '}, page_content='Since the start of the pandemic, at least 50,000 meatpacking workers have contracted coronavirus and 250 have died, according to Investigate Midwest tracking. People of color make up 60 percent of the meatpacking workforce but accounted for 90 percent of coronavirus infections in the industry in the pandemic’s first few months. The new USDA analysis compared rural counties with a large number of meatpacking plants to areas that depended on another manufacturing industry between mid-March to mid-September 2020. Krumel and his coauthor, Corey Goodrich, a University of Connecticut research analyst, found that COVID-19 cases in meatpacking-dependent rural counties in mid-April 2020 were nearly 10 times higher than in other areas that depended on other manufacturing industries. By mid-July 2020, however, the number of coronavirus cases in meatpacking plants had dropped and the difference between meatpacking-dependent counties and the other areas disappeared. The pattern remained the same throughout the rest of the time studied. The September report ascribed the situation to meatpacking companies implementing policies to protect workers, such as requiring face masks and erecting physical barriers. However, the researchers couldn’t verify that safety precautions single-handedly caused the change. Licolli said that workers and advocates had to fight to get companies to implement safety measures, demanding workplaces provide personal protection equipment. Even after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advised manufacturing workers to be six feet apart, Licolli said, workers still found themselves working in close proximity and in crowded hallways. Meatpacking uniquely susceptible to disease outbreaks, report finds The analysis found key differences between meatpacking and other manufacturing industries, with the most significant being physical proximity between employees. This was followed by exposure to disease and infections, which could be attributed to workers coming into contact with foodborne illnesses.

By the end of May, at least 287 of the plant’s employees had been infected. “But we believe the actual number of cases linked to the facility is likely higher,” Josh Greer, public information officer at Bear River Health Department in Logan, Utah, told The Nation’s Health in June. “Trying to trace each case is becoming less and less realistic.” Typical working conditions inside meatpacking plants make the perfect setting for coronavirus spread. Employees work close together; they breathe heavily while doing physically intense, high-speed labor, which makes it harder to consistently wear face coverings; the plants are cold, which may affect how well the virus survives; and workers often lack access to paid sick leave. Nationwide, as of late June, infections tied to meatpacking facilities had climbed to nearly 28,000 cases and 100 deaths across 250 plants, according to the Food and Environment Reporting Network, which is mapping COVID-19 outbreaks in the food system. Greer said health staff worked closely with the JBS beef plant in Hyrum, Utah, as it readied for COVID-19. He said the plant reported a number of preventive measures, such as temperature screenings, face shields, increased sanitation and plastic dividers between workers on the processing line to keep people safe. But none of it kept the virus away. Near the end of May, local COVID-19 case numbers suddenly rose, prompting a mass testing event at the Hyrum plant. Of the almost 1,000 workers screened, about a third were positive. Without enough resources to contain the outbreak on its own, Greer said the Bear River Health Department quickly recruited staff from other local health agencies to help with disease investigation and tracing.

There is no existing OSHA rule that comprehensively addresses an employer’s duty to protect workers from airborne infectious disease. The agency has issued guidance for employers — such as it did for meatpacking plants in April — but the recommendations are not mandatory. And while an emergency OSHA rule would not eliminate COVID-19 risks, Michaels said it could still make a difference, despite OSHA’s severely limited enforcement resources. “If OSHA moved quickly and issued some high-profile, high-penalty citations, that would send a very strong message to employers,” Michaels said, citing a recent study that found one OSHA news release about violations yielded compliance equal to more than 200 inspections. In May, AFL-CIO sued OSHA to compel it to issue a temporary emergency COVID-19 rule that would require employers to develop COVID-19 safety plans. A court ruled against the union in June, and it promptly filed for a rehearing, said APHA member Rebecca Reindel, MPH, MS, director of occupational safety and health at AFL-CIO. Many essential workers who face the highest COVID-19 risks also have the fewest labor protections and face the biggest barriers to speaking up about safety, Reindel said. A recent survey from the National Employment Law Project found that Black workers were twice as likely as white workers to report that they or a fellow employee may have been punished or fired for speaking up about COVID-19 risks at work. “Right now, workplace safety and public safety are so interconnected,” she told The Nation’s Health. “If workers aren’t protected, then everyone’s at risk.” '}, page_content='The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also stationed a team at the health department. But the challenges are steep, Greer said in June, and the caseload is overwhelming. “This has been an experience like none other,” he said. Across the U.S., fewer than one-third of workers can do their jobs from home, putting the rest of the labor force at higher risk of COVID-19 and underscoring the critical role of workplace safety in preventing spread. There is no way to know exactly how many U.S. COVID-19 infections are due to workplace exposures, though some sectors — such as health care, food processing, meatpacking, agriculture, public transit, retail and sanitation — face higher risks and are hotspots for infection. On June 25, United Food and Commercial Workers International Union reported that 238 of its members — workers in the grocery, meatpacking, food processing and health care industries — had died from COVID-19 and about 29,000 had been infected or exposed in the pandemic’s first 100 days. In response, the union called for reinstating hazard pay in all states where COVID-19 is rising, mandating masks in public and creating a national registry where all employers with more than 1,000 workers have to regularly release data on COVID-19 illnesses, deaths and exposures. Despite pleas from APHA and other advocates, the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration had failed to issue an emergency safety standard for COVID-19 as of early July, relegating worker safety to a patchwork of state systems and voluntary guidance. A June report from the Department of Labor’s Office of Inspector General found that “unless proper precautions are taken, avoidable COVID-19 infections and deaths may occur” as more people return to work.

Most workers in Nebraska reported that their employers had taken some actions to try to stop the spread of COVID-19 in the plant like taking people’s temperatures as they enter the facility, making everyone wear a face mask while in the building, and posting multilingual signage. Regrettably, other effective infection prevention and control actions like increasing the distance between workers on the line, providing paid sick leave, restructuring shifts to reduce the number of people that are together at a time, and slowing down the speed of the line were much less frequently reported (Figure 1).

Recently, Nebraska State Senator Tony Vargas sought to require key COVID-19 protections for meatpacking workers such as six feet of distance between workers, and an amendment outlining these strategies was added to LB 667.

This meager penalty underscores that, during the first six months of the pandemic, in no community have the foundational inequities in U.S. society become more visible than among poultry and meatpacking workers. They are the most impacted group of workers in the United States, but under the current federal health and safety enforcement regime, perhaps the least protected. One of the most dangerous and exploitative industries in the country, the slaughter and processing of the meat we eat relies heavily upon rural workers—disproportionately immigrants, refugees, and people of color—who have few better options.

At those plants alone, almost 1,500 workers have been infected and at least 12 have died, but the fines totaled just $29,000—an amount criticized as far too lenient by experts, former government officials, and worker advocates alike. This meager penalty underscores that, during the first six months of the pandemic, in no community have the foundational inequities in U.S. society become more visible than among poultry and meatpacking workers. They are the most impacted group of workers in the United States, but under the current federal health and safety enforcement regime, perhaps the least protected. One of the most dangerous and exploitative industries in the country, the slaughter and processing of the meat we eat relies heavily upon rural workers—disproportionately immigrants, refugees, and people of color—who have few better options. According to the Food and Environment Reporting Network (FERN), which has tracked the spread of the coronavirus in this industry since April, as of September 22 at least 42,708 people in 496 meat and poultry plants have been infected with COVID-19, and at least 203 have died. These figures and the lives they represent highlight how race, ethnicity, citizenship, and class status intersect to shape individual and collective life chances. They also illustrate the ways in which population health outcomes are shaped by labor policies and practices. As the media work to highlight the impact of COVID-19 among meat and poultry workers, reporters have sought reliable data to deepen our understanding of this industry. Their first and most basic question: Who are the people who labor in this node of America’s food chain? What is the racial and ethnic composition of the workforce? Where are they from? Which languages do they speak? \\nSome of the existing ethnographic data—including from our own research—provides vital insight into the rich textures of workers’ lives on the line and at home, but unfortunately often can’t answer these questions at the macro level. Here, we set out to explore how existing demographic data—most of which comes from government surveys—might help provide a broader scaffolding for answering these questions on a national scale and by state. While data from the U.S. Census Bureau continues to be the best source of demographic data available, some of what we found was not consistent with what we have learned in ethnographic research about the profiles of meat and poultry workers. This blog post explains why that might be the case and urges caution, particularly when relying on state-level breakdowns of those data. The U.S. Department of Labor’s Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW), which is based on data reported directly by employers to unemployment insurance agencies, provides the best available estimate of the total number of workers nationwide in animal slaughtering and processing by state. It reports the five-year average, as of 2018, as 498,848 people (230,733 in poultry and 268,115 in red meat). The QCEW estimates shown in Table 1 list the top five meatpacking and poultry states, by number of workers, and serve to corroborate what is widely known—that the poultry industry has flourished in the states of the Deep South, while meatpacking is concentrated principally in the Midwest and Plains states.1 Top five meatpacking and poultry processing states, by number of workers Notes: Figures represent the five-year average of workers reported by firms, by industrial sector in each state from January 2014 through December 2018.

He said the plant reported a number of preventive measures, such as temperature screenings, face shields, increased sanitation and plastic dividers between workers on the processing line to keep people safe. But none of it kept the virus away. Near the end of May, local COVID-19 case numbers suddenly rose, prompting a mass testing event at the Hyrum plant.

In response, the union called for reinstating hazard pay in all states where COVID-19 is rising, mandating masks in public and creating a national registry where all employers with more than 1,000 workers have to regularly release data on COVID-19 illnesses, deaths and exposures. Despite pleas from APHA and other advocates, the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration had failed to issue an emergency safety standard for COVID-19 as of early July, relegating worker safety to a patchwork of state systems and voluntary guidance. A June report from the Department of Labor’s Office of Inspector General found that “unless proper precautions are taken, avoidable COVID-19 infections and deaths may occur” as more people return to work. \\n“In many ways, workplace exposures have become the fulcrum of the epidemic,” said APHA member David Michaels, PhD, MPH, who served as OSHA’s longest-serving administrator from 2009 to 2017 and is now a professor at the George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health.

COVID-19 Working Paper: Meatpacking Working Conditions and the Spread of COVID-19, AP-092  Table 1 and figure 2 provide strong evidence that the outbreaks within the meatpacking industry can  likely be attributed to workers' uniquely high physical proximity. They also raise the possibility that meatpacking might be more susceptible to disease and virus outbreaks generally. However, further work should aim at distinguishing the possible contributions from foodborne and airborne illnesses. While other characteristics, such as low temperatures or a loud work environment could lead to higher rates of COVID-19 spread, neither factor was found to significantly vary between meatpacking and other  manufacturing industries. In the case of a loud work environment, which may increase the spread of the disease due to increased particle admission when having to shout, meatpacking was below the sample  Supplementing these results are the findings from Taylor et al. (2020) that meatpacking companies that had received a waiver to increase production speeds saw increased rates of COVID-19 compared with  plants that received no such waiver. Plants with higher line speeds (i.e., faster equipment) likely also necessarily increased physical proximity between their workers. Günther et al. (2020) documented the spread of COVID-19 at a single large meatpacking plant, highlighting the importance of physical  proximity in the spread of the disease. They found evidence that cases that spread within the plant had a significant spatial pattern. Specifically, there was significant transmission of COVID-19 to co-workers working within close physical proximity. Using information collected on living conditions and  \\ntransportation of individuals at this meatpacking plant, their data also strongly suggested that while there may have been secondary infections outside of work, transmission most likely occurred at the processing plant. Extrapolating their findings to our results, inference that many of the cases observed in our meatpacking-dependent counties occurred via close physical proximity to workers with COVID-19 and  likely not through secondary infections from outside the processing plant.   Further complementing our results is an additional report from the CDC, which evaluated a single  meatpacking plant in South Dakota (Steinberg et al., 2020). This report found frontline workers, who often work in close proximity to one another, had higher case rates of COVID-19 compared with other  workers. Furthermore, salaried workers who had individual workstations (thus enabling them to increase physical distance and implement physical barriers) experienced lower rates relative to hourly workers with less access to such amenities. While the CDC focused on a single meatpacking plant, it provides anecdotal context supporting our findings. Since industry-specific data was analyzed, our results are likely valid for the entire industry at large in that the physical proximity of workers was a primary driver of the COVID-19 outbreaks experienced across meatpacking.

Figure 3 illustrates the ratio of cases between meatpacking- and other manufacturing-dependent counties as defined above.23,24 As shown in this figure, the caseloads between the two groups were similar until mid-April 2020, with meatpacking-dependent counties starting a slight decline in new COVID numbers.  23 Since we are presenting our results as a ratio (meatpacking divided by manufacturing), it is worth mentioning that meatpacking and other manufacturing are equal at a value of 1. Greater than 1 means that meatpacking is higher than manufacturing, while a value of less than 1 signifies that meatpacking is lower than manufacturing.  24 Appendix B tracks the data as separate categories rather than presenting the ratio.   COVID-19 Working Paper: Meatpacking Working Conditions and the Spread of COVID-19, AP-092  At this time, cases began to climb substantially within rural meatpacking-dependent counties relative to all other rural manufacturing-dependent counties. The peak of this disparity occurred in early May 2020, with meatpacking-dependent counties having nearly 10 times as many cases per day, compared with the  other counties in our study.25 During the next 2 months, there was a significant drop until early July 2020, at which point both groups of counties experienced almost identical caseloads for the remainder of our data frame. It should be noted that there was an increase in COVID-19 cases in other manufacturing- dependent counties during May and June 2020; however, the growth was substantially smaller than the  decrease in daily cases in meatpacking-dependent counties during the end of May through June 2020.26 Therefore, figure 3 provides suggestive evidence that there was some change within these meatpacking- dependent counties driving this drop, rather than being driven by an increase in cases from the other \"), Evidence(question='What is the total number of COVID-19 cases among health care workers according to the USDA?', answer='The USDA does not provide a specific number of COVID-19 cases among health care workers in the provided sources.', url='https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/publications/102206/ap-092.pdf', scraped_text=\"respectively.

Plants with higher line speeds (i.e., faster equipment) likely also necessarily increased physical proximity between their workers. Günther et al. (2020) documented the spread of COVID-19 at a single large meatpacking plant, highlighting the importance of physical  proximity in the spread of the disease. They found evidence that cases that spread within the plant had a significant spatial pattern. Specifically, there was significant transmission of COVID-19 to co-workers working within close physical proximity. Using information collected on living conditions and  \\ntransportation of individuals at this meatpacking plant, their data also strongly suggested that while there may have been secondary infections outside of work, transmission most likely occurred at the processing plant. Extrapolating their findings to our results, inference that many of the cases observed in our meatpacking-dependent counties occurred via close physical proximity to workers with COVID-19 and  likely not through secondary infections from outside the processing plant.   Further complementing our results is an additional report from the CDC, which evaluated a single  meatpacking plant in South Dakota (Steinberg et al., 2020). This report found frontline workers, who often work in close proximity to one another, had higher case rates of COVID-19 compared with other  workers. Furthermore, salaried workers who had individual workstations (thus enabling them to increase physical distance and implement physical barriers) experienced lower rates relative to hourly workers with less access to such amenities. While the CDC focused on a single meatpacking plant, it provides anecdotal context supporting our findings. Since industry-specific data was analyzed, our results are likely valid for the entire industry at large in that the physical proximity of workers was a primary driver of the COVID-19 outbreaks experienced across meatpacking.

C., Schott, \\nP. K., and Yang, N. J. 2020. Imputing Missing Values in the U.S. Census Bureau's County Business Patterns, No. w26632. Figure 3 illustrates the ratio of cases between meatpacking- and other manufacturing-dependent counties as defined above.23,24 As shown in this figure, the caseloads between the two groups were similar until mid-April 2020, with meatpacking-dependent counties starting a slight decline in new COVID numbers.  23 Since we are presenting our results as a ratio (meatpacking divided by manufacturing), it is worth mentioning that meatpacking and other manufacturing are equal at a value of 1. Greater than 1 means that meatpacking is higher than manufacturing, while a value of less than 1 signifies that meatpacking is lower than manufacturing.  24 Appendix B tracks the data as separate categories rather than presenting the ratio.   COVID-19 Working Paper: Meatpacking Working Conditions and the Spread of COVID-19, AP-092  At this time, cases began to climb substantially within rural meatpacking-dependent counties relative to all other rural manufacturing-dependent counties. The peak of this disparity occurred in early May 2020, with meatpacking-dependent counties having nearly 10 times as many cases per day, compared with the  other counties in our study.25 During the next 2 months, there was a significant drop until early July 2020, at which point both groups of counties experienced almost identical caseloads for the remainder of our data frame. It should be noted that there was an increase in COVID-19 cases in other manufacturing- dependent counties during May and June 2020; however, the growth was substantially smaller than the  decrease in daily cases in meatpacking-dependent counties during the end of May through June 2020.26 Therefore, figure 3 provides suggestive evidence that there was some change within these meatpacking- dependent counties driving this drop, rather than being driven by an increase in cases from the other \"), Evidence(question='What is the total number of COVID-19 cases among meatpacking workers according to the CDC?', answer='The CDC does not provide a specific number of COVID-19 cases among meatpacking workers in the provided sources.', url='https://migration.ucdavis.edu/rmn/more.php?id=2446', scraped_text='\\nMeatpacking was considered an essential business during the coronavirus emergency, so most animal dis-assembly plants expected their employees to work. Meatpacking plants are cold, have many metal surfaces, and are often loud, forcing workers to raise their voices to be heard and contributing to the spread of Covid. Meatpacking plants, nursing homes, and prisons were three hotspots for Covid-19. About three-fourths of meatpacking workers are represented by unions, which called on meatpackers to slow line speeds so that workers could be spaced further apart. Some workers staged protests, alleging that the plants placed employees too close together to prevent the spread of the virus. The United Food and Commercial Workers union, which represents 250,000 meatpacking workers, reported that 15,700 meatpacking workers contracted Covid-19 by July 2020, and 76 died. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in July 2020 released a report on 16,000 Covid-19 cases at 239 meatpacking plants in 21 states that found that 87 percent of meatpacking workers infected were racial or ethnic minorities; these minorities were 61 percent of workers. White non-Hispanics are 39 percent of meatpacking workers, and they accounted for 13 percent of Covid-19 cases. The share of workers infected varied from three to 24 percent across plants. The US has 800 federally inspected slaughterhouses, but the largest 50 account for most US meat production, including 15 that process 60 percent of US pork. Most of the plants owned by Tyson Foods, JBS USA and Smithfield Foods have over 500 employees and are not required to offer paid sick leave. Nonetheless, some began to offer paid sick leave, and some offered bonuses of up to $500 a month to employees who did not miss any work. \\nTyson, JBS and Smithfield closed 15 plants in April 2020, reducing the US pork supply by a quarter. Tyson closed its largest pork plant in Waterloo, Iowa after almost 30 percent of the 2,700 employees tested positive for Covid-19, and closed another plant in Storm Lake, Iowa after a quarter of the 2,300 workers tested positive. Smithfield Foods closed its 3,700 employee Sioux Falls, South Dakota plant that processes 19,500 hogs a day after over 500 workers tested positive; 30 percent of Covid-19 cases in South Dakota are linked to meatpacking plants. Smithfield, which employs 40,000 workers in the US, was bought by China?s WH Group Ltd in 2013 for $4.7 billion. South Dakota was one of five US states that did not issue stay at home orders during the pandemic. President Trump in April 2020 signed an executive order that deemed meatpacking plants to be ?critical infrastructure,? making federal authorities responsible for worker safety in meatpacking plants and barring suits from workers who contract Covid-19 at work. Unions asked meat processors to test all workers before reopening closed plants. Trump?s order allowed the plants to reopen without testing workers. Meatpackers and many other US employers required workers returning to work to sign liability waivers, promising not to sue if they contracted Covid-19 at work. In some states, essential workers who contract Covid-19 are assumed to have contracted the disease at work, making it easier to obtain workers compensation benefits. Many service firms such as gyms and parks required their customers to sign liability waivers. Most meatpacking plants reopened after deep cleanings at slower line speeds. As a result, there were too many hogs for meatpackers to process, and hundreds of thousands were gassed. Piglets become market-ready after six months, when they weigh about 300 pounds. Large hog farms are constantly raising new piglets, so they have little extra space to hold market-ready hogs that cannot be processed.

By the end of May, at least 287 of the plant’s employees had been infected. “But we believe the actual number of cases linked to the facility is likely higher,” Josh Greer, public information officer at Bear River Health Department in Logan, Utah, told The Nation’s Health in June. “Trying to trace each case is becoming less and less realistic.” Typical working conditions inside meatpacking plants make the perfect setting for coronavirus spread. Employees work close together; they breathe heavily while doing physically intense, high-speed labor, which makes it harder to consistently wear face coverings; the plants are cold, which may affect how well the virus survives; and workers often lack access to paid sick leave. Nationwide, as of late June, infections tied to meatpacking facilities had climbed to nearly 28,000 cases and 100 deaths across 250 plants, according to the Food and Environment Reporting Network, which is mapping COVID-19 outbreaks in the food system. Greer said health staff worked closely with the JBS beef plant in Hyrum, Utah, as it readied for COVID-19. He said the plant reported a number of preventive measures, such as temperature screenings, face shields, increased sanitation and plastic dividers between workers on the processing line to keep people safe. But none of it kept the virus away. Near the end of May, local COVID-19 case numbers suddenly rose, prompting a mass testing event at the Hyrum plant. Of the almost 1,000 workers screened, about a third were positive. Without enough resources to contain the outbreak on its own, Greer said the Bear River Health Department quickly recruited staff from other local health agencies to help with disease investigation and tracing. \\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also stationed a team at the health department. But the challenges are steep, Greer said in June, and the caseload is overwhelming. “This has been an experience like none other,” he said. Across the U.S., fewer than one-third of workers can do their jobs from home, putting the rest of the labor force at higher risk of COVID-19 and underscoring the critical role of workplace safety in preventing spread. There is no way to know exactly how many U.S. COVID-19 infections are due to workplace exposures, though some sectors — such as health care, food processing, meatpacking, agriculture, public transit, retail and sanitation — face higher risks and are hotspots for infection. On June 25, United Food and Commercial Workers International Union reported that 238 of its members — workers in the grocery, meatpacking, food processing and health care industries — had died from COVID-19 and about 29,000 had been infected or exposed in the pandemic’s first 100 days. In response, the union called for reinstating hazard pay in all states where COVID-19 is rising, mandating masks in public and creating a national registry where all employers with more than 1,000 workers have to regularly release data on COVID-19 illnesses, deaths and exposures. Despite pleas from APHA and other advocates, the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration had failed to issue an emergency safety standard for COVID-19 as of early July, relegating worker safety to a patchwork of state systems and voluntary guidance. A June report from the Department of Labor’s Office of Inspector General found that “unless proper precautions are taken, avoidable COVID-19 infections and deaths may occur” as more people return to work. \\n“In many ways, workplace exposures have become the fulcrum of the epidemic,” said APHA member David Michaels, PhD, MPH, who served as OSHA’s longest-serving administrator from 2009 to 2017 and is now a professor at the George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health. There is no existing OSHA rule that comprehensively addresses an employer’s duty to protect workers from airborne infectious disease. The agency has issued guidance for employers — such as it did for meatpacking plants in April — but the recommendations are not mandatory. And while an emergency OSHA rule would not eliminate COVID-19 risks, Michaels said it could still make a difference, despite OSHA’s severely limited enforcement resources. “If OSHA moved quickly and issued some high-profile, high-penalty citations, that would send a very strong message to employers,” Michaels said, citing a recent study that found one OSHA news release about violations yielded compliance equal to more than 200 inspections. In May, AFL-CIO sued OSHA to compel it to issue a temporary emergency COVID-19 rule that would require employers to develop COVID-19 safety plans. A court ruled against the union in June, and it promptly filed for a rehearing, said APHA member Rebecca Reindel, MPH, MS, director of occupational safety and health at AFL-CIO. Many essential workers who face the highest COVID-19 risks also have the fewest labor protections and face the biggest barriers to speaking up about safety, Reindel said. A recent survey from the National Employment Law Project found that Black workers were twice as likely as white workers to report that they or a fellow employee may have been punished or fired for speaking up about COVID-19 risks at work. “Right now, workplace safety and public safety are so interconnected,” she told The Nation’s Health. “If workers aren’t protected, then everyone’s at risk.” '), Evidence(question='What is the total number of COVID-19 cases among meatpacking workers according to the Food and Environment Reporting Network?', answer='According to the Food and Environment Reporting Network, as of late June, infections tied to meatpacking facilities had climbed to nearly 28,000 cases.', url='https://www.thenationshealth.org/content/50/6/1.1', scraped_text='Coordinated work against COVID-19 between health officials in northern Utah and a local meatpacking plant began in early March — before any confirmed cases in the area.
