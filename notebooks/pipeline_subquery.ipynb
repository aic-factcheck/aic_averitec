Finance Minister Patrick Chinamasa promised in a budget speech last week to re-engage with international lenders, curb spending and attract investors to revive the economy. '}, page_content='The African Export and Import Bank has pledged up to $1.5 billion in new loans and financial guarantees to Zimbabwe in a major boost for new President Emmerson Mnangagwa\\'s government, the bank\\'s president and chairman said Tuesday. Mnangagwa, who took over last month after veteran autocrat Robert Mugabe quit following a de facto military coup, has vowed to focus on reviving the struggling economy and provide jobs in a nation with an unemployment rate exceeding 80 percent. Afreximbank was the only international lender that stood by Zimbabwe throughout Mugabe\\'s repressive 37-year rule, but its quick announcement of a fresh package of loans and guarantees appeared to be a vote of confidence in the new government. Cairo-based Afreximbank was a major funder of Zimbabwe while the country was cut off from the International Monetary Fund and World Bank for having defaulted on its debt in 1999. Bank president and chairman Okey Oramah told reporters after a meeting with Mnangagwa and senior government officials that Afreximbank would provide $150 million to local banks to help them pay for outstanding critical imports. \"We also discussed a number of other areas that involve additional investment from us for something that will be in the order of $1 billion to $1.5 billion that will include certain kinds of guarantees to encourage investors to come to Zimbabwe. \"We ... want to make sure that we support the stabilization of the economy, that means providing liquidity to make sure that the situation where people are rushing every time to look for cash is dealt with,\" Oramah said. In August, before Mugabe\\'s ouster, Afreximbank provided $600 million to help Zimbabwe pay for imports and $300 million to allow it to print more \"bond notes,\" a quasi-currency that officially trades on par with the U.S. dollar. Zimbabwe has a foreign debt of more than $7 billion and in September said it would not be able to pay $1.8 billion in arrears to the World Bank and African Development Bank until economic fundamentals improved.

The independent daily Newsday quoted Biti as saying that Matabeleland firms received US$12 million of a total US$30 million disbursed by the Commercial Bank of Zimbabwe and Interfin under the Zimbabwe Economic and Trade Revival Facility to date, or 40 percent. He said more applications from the region had been expected. Biti attributed the low uptake of funds to a lack of information about how to apply for capital which is being made available at a 15 percent interest rate. The going market rate for business loans in Zimbabwe is close to 30 percent. Bankers said fewer than 200 companies nationwide have applied for loans ranging from US$250,000 to US$1.5 million. Banks disbursing the money declined to provide details on the application and approval process. Minister Biti was not available for comment. Bulisani Ncube, Matabeleland regional manager of the Zimbabwe National Chamber of Commerce said that government bureaucracy is hindering the placement of loans. “If the government does not make any effort to provide the necessary information about these loan facilities, we end up believing that such projects are crafted by some parties to gain political mileage,” Ncube said. Economist James Wade said the government should make sure that the loan application process is clearly explained to companies in need of working capital. Economist Prosper Chitambara agreed that red tape is impeding industrial revival. “I believe that whoever is in charge of managing these funds ought to be proactive in dealing with companies that require credit lines,” Chitambara said.

The Afreximbank Trade Debt-backed Securities (AFTRADES) will be provided to participating banks as debt securities that could be used as collateral for interbank funds placements in order to promote interbank dealings among Zimbabwean Banks active in trade finance, according to the terms of a memorandum of understanding signed on by Afreximbank, the Zimbabwe Ministry of Finance and Economic Development and the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe. “Our objective is to use this facility to enable trade finance banks in Zimbabwe to access much-needed liquidity from cash-surplus banks in the country, thereby increasing their capacity to deepen their trade finance activities,” said Jean-Louis Ekra, President of Afreximbank, after signing the memorandum of understanding in Cairo on 10 February. Patrick Chinamasa, Minister of Finance and Economic Planning, and Dr. Charity L. Dhliwayo, Acting Governor of the Reserve Bank, had signed it on 31 January on behalf of the Zimbabwean parties. Mr. Ekra said that Afreximbank’s decision to introduce the facility was motivated by its recognition of the serious constraints limiting the access of Zimbabwe’s trade finance banks to funding as a result of the liquidity challenge confronting the financial sector. Under the terms of the memorandum of understanding, AFTRADES would be structured as a collateral swap involving the issuance of securities by Afreximbank to participating banks in exchange for trade–related collateral or securities presented by those banks.

Only solvent banks which are not facing fundamental problems of viability will be eligible for the facility, according to the memorandum.

Its two basic constitutive documents are the Establishment Agreement, which gives it the status of an international organization, and the Charter, which governs its corporate structure and operations.

The MOU states that the line of credit is expected to boost trade into and out of Zimbabwe and will promote the country’s economic development. The signing ceremony was held on the sidelines of the 114th meeting of the Board of Directors of Afreximbank, which ended in Harare yesterday.

The Bank was established in October 1993 by African governments, African private and institutional investors, and non-African investors. Its two basic constitutive documents are the Establishment Agreement, which gives it the status of an international organization, and the Charter, which governs its corporate structure and operations. Since 1994, it has approved more than $51 billion in credit facilities for African businesses, including about $10.3 billion in 2016. Afreximbank had total assets of $11.7 billion as at 31 December 2016 and is rated BBB+ (GCR), Baa1 (Moody’s), and BBB- (Fitch).

'), Document(metadata={'url': 'https://www.brookings.edu/articles/zimbabwes-economic-reform-challenges/', 'context_before': 'Ten months ago, on August 26, 2015, Zimbabwe’s 92-year old leader, Robert Mugabe announced a 10-point plan to revitalize economic growth. Since then, the government has taken steps that signal the intention to transform a moribund economy. But the question is whether a Mugabe-led government can be successful in restoring growth and confidence in a once-promising economy that has been severely mismanaged for the better part of two decades. An economic reform initiative in Zimbabwe has been long overdue. GDP growth has dropped well below 2 percent, and the economy is half the size it was 15 years ago. The country is experiencing its most severe drought in 20 years due to El-Niño conditions and nearly three million people are at risk of starvation. Poverty is expected to rise in 2016, and the poor, especially in the rural areas, will be most impacted. Certain aspects of the reform initiative represent significant departures from past policies and deserve careful review. The bigger challenge is whether the program can succeed given the government’s poor track record on human rights, respect for the rule of law, and the intensifying competition to fill Zimbabwe’s growing leadership vacuum, given Mugabe’s advanced age. Moreover, the recent announcement by Reserve Bank Governor John Mangudya that he will introduce local “bond notes” has raised fears that the cash-strapped economy will return to the chaos and hyper-inflation that crippled the economy prior to the move to the dollar in 2009. Even though local coins have already been introduced into the economy, and Mangudya has a $200 million loan from the Africa Export-Import Bank to support the notes, his plan for a local currency has deepened the country’s economic anxiety, especially among Zimbabwean businesses and professionals. There is no question that Zimbabwe is taking strides to reform its economy. ', 'context_after': 'A fully functioning long-term lease program, including transferable title, would enable farmers to use their leases as collateral with commercial banks to secure loans. As important, 99-year leases would help restore the rule of law to a sector defined by violence, illegal seizures, and cronyism. Commercial banks, however, do not yet have sufficient confidence in the structure of the program or that land seizures have stopped completely and the banks have not begun to accept the leases as collateral for commercial loans to farmers. Perhaps the most unexpected reform was the March announcement made by Finance Minister Chinamasa that the government of Zimbabwe would pay “fair compensation” to the estimated 4800 white farmers forced off their land. Few issues have been as central to Zimbabwe’s isolation in the global community as the forced evictions and land seizures that began in 2000 and destroyed the country’s most productive economic sector. Sustained progress in restitution would be an important indicator of the government’s commitment to a new era of respect for the rule of law. The government expects to finance the compensation program, which according to some estimates would cost more than $10 billion, through the imposition of a land tax, treasury bills, and donor support. The government has since announced that it has begun to repay former white commercial farmers who lost land and has undertaken a countrywide effort to evaluate the seized farms in order to pay the former landholders for the improvements they made. However, the land compensation program has been described as an “illusion of reform,” by former Finance Minister Tendai Biti’s People’s Democratic Party (PDP). Indeed, under present circumstances, it is hard to envision Zimbabwe replicating Uganda’s experience where authorities have returned an estimated 3,493 of the more than 8,170 properties confiscated from the Asian community by Idi Amin in the early 1970s. '}, page_content='At the annual IMF/World Bank meetings in Lima, Peru last October. Zimbabwe’s finance minister, Patrick Chinamasa, and Mangyuda presented a plan to settle the country’s $1.8 billion debt to the international financial institutions (IFIs). Zimbabwe has been in default for 15 years to the IFIs and is the only nation in the world in arrears to the World Bank’s non-concessional lending window, the IBRD. The government recently completed successfully an IMF Staff Monitored program that has paved the way for this effort by building a favorable track record. The repayment plan is predicated on a loan of nearly $1 billion from Algeria, to be repaid over 10 years, and bridge financing of $400 million from the Africa Export-Import Bank that will be used to settle the country’s obligation to the African Development Bank. Given low oil prices, however, it is unclear when the loan will become available although Algerian authorities have indicated they intend to provide the resources. An element of flexibility has also been introduced into the government’s indigenization policy, Mugabe’s signature program that requires foreign investors to give majority control of their investments to locals. Line ministers, such as in agriculture and industry, are now able to negotiate indigenization plans with investors. While 51 percent equity will have to be handed over by foreign companies who invest in natural resources, “empowerment credits” can be negotiated to achieve the 51 percent threshold in other sectors. Even in its revised form, though, Zimbabwe’s indigenization policy is the most onerous set of local content requirements of any country in Africa and remains a significant deterrent to attracting new investment. Another reform proposed by the Zimbabwe government is a program now being advertised by the Ministry of Lands and Rural Resettlement that would enable farmers to lease land for 99 years.

Leaked internal documents obtained by the Post show an exhaustive list of celebrities who were approached to participate in the ad campaign, and everyone from Miranda Cosgrove to Meryl Streep is included, making the list a fascinating look at who’s famous at this moment… as well as which demographics the Trump administration thought each celeb could help reach. It’s quite a silly read. They think Lin-Manuel Miranda is perfect for Asian-American outreach, for some reason — perhaps just racist assumptions based on his name rather than any idea of who he is as a person. They seem to have ruled Christina Aguilera out of consideration because she “is a gay-rights supporting liberal,” whereas Lady Gaga’s entry bizarrely says she “has not specifically claimed any political side.” It’s a pop culture-obsessive’s delight, seeing through the looking glass at what conservatives apparently think of celebrities — who tend, typically, to be on our side. Many entertainment news outlets, though, chose to cover this story by zeroing in on one particular spreadsheet entry — the one about music’s it-girl Billie Eilish. In particular, outlets from the AV Club to Billboard, from NME and Complex to LoveBScott, all wrote something along the lines of: “Leaked documents show the Trump administration thinks Billie Eilish is ‘destroying our country and everything we care about.’” That’d be funny… if it were true.

Some folks are saying the WaPo took the \"destroying our country and everything we care about\" quote out of context. It\\'s what Billie said about Trump at the DNC, and allegedly NOT what a top Trump official said about her.

Billie Eilish is destroying the very fabric of American life ... at least that\\'s how officials in Donald Trump\\'s administration view the pop sensation. Here\\'s the deal ... a top Trump administration official put a decidedly partisan spin on a $250 million campaign it wanted to roll out weeks before the election, aiming to \"defeat despair and inspire\" hope amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

Billie drew much of the Trump administration\\'s scorn ... in the docs, which the Washington Post says were obtained by Democrats in the House, the Trump official described the singer as \"not a Trump Supporter\" and accused her of \"destroying our country and everything we care about.\" Billie\\'s bad review makes sense ... she performed earlier this year at the Democratic National Convention, and she said the President was destroying the country. Guess her phrasing struck a chord with Trump\\'s camp.

But, in what appeared to be a move designed to support President Donald Trump ahead of Election Day, a top Trump administration official inserted “partisan political interests” into the $250 million advertising contract by disqualifying certain stars based on their political affiliations. Per the Post, the documents for the project (obtained by Democratic lawmakers) showed that some stars were ultimately excluded from consideration because they have criticized Trump, publicly supported Barack Obama, or were supportive of gay rights and same-sex marriage. Eilish, for example, was said to be unfit to participate because she was “not a Trump Supporter.” The documents also reportedly said that the 18-year-old was \"destroying our country and everything we care about.\" \\nOther stars, including Jennifer Lopez and director Judd Apatow, were also reportedly vetoed due to their past criticisms of the president. The Post reported that of at least 247 celebrities that were considered, only 10 were apparently approved: Dennis Quaid, Marc Anthony, Enrique Iglesias, Billy Ray Cyrus, Miranda Lambert, Garth Brooks, Dwyane Wade, Dr. Oz, CeCe Winans, and Shulem Lemmer. The \"Bad Guy\" singer has been vocal in her disapproval of Trump. In August, Eilish performed her latest single during a virtual appearance at the 2020 Democratic National Convention. Before launching into her rendition of \"My Future,\" however, Eilish gave an impassioned speech decrying Trump and his handling of the coronavirus pandemic. \"You don\\'t need me to tell you things are a mess,\" Eilish said. \"Donald Trump is destroying our country and everything we care about. We need leaders who will solve problems like climate change and COVID, not deny them. Leaders who will fight against systemic racism and inequality.\" Eilish continued: \"And that starts by voting for someone who understands how much is at stake. Someone who\\'s building a team that shares our values. It starts with voting against Donald Trump and for Joe Biden. Silence is not an option, and we cannot sit this one out.\" Eilish pressed the importance of the election and told viewers \"to vote like our lives and the world depend on it, because they do.\" She concluded: \"The only way to be certain of the future is to make it ourselves.
