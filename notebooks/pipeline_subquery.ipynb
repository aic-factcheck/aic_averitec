Finance Minister Patrick Chinamasa promised in a budget speech last week to re-engage with international lenders, curb spending and attract investors to revive the economy. ', 'queries': ['Zimbabwe African Export Import Bank loan percentage 2020']}, page_content='The African Export and Import Bank has pledged up to $1.5 billion in new loans and financial guarantees to Zimbabwe in a major boost for new President Emmerson Mnangagwa\\'s government, the bank\\'s president and chairman said Tuesday. Mnangagwa, who took over last month after veteran autocrat Robert Mugabe quit following a de facto military coup, has vowed to focus on reviving the struggling economy and provide jobs in a nation with an unemployment rate exceeding 80 percent. Afreximbank was the only international lender that stood by Zimbabwe throughout Mugabe\\'s repressive 37-year rule, but its quick announcement of a fresh package of loans and guarantees appeared to be a vote of confidence in the new government. Cairo-based Afreximbank was a major funder of Zimbabwe while the country was cut off from the International Monetary Fund and World Bank for having defaulted on its debt in 1999. Bank president and chairman Okey Oramah told reporters after a meeting with Mnangagwa and senior government officials that Afreximbank would provide $150 million to local banks to help them pay for outstanding critical imports. \"We also discussed a number of other areas that involve additional investment from us for something that will be in the order of $1 billion to $1.5 billion that will include certain kinds of guarantees to encourage investors to come to Zimbabwe. \"We ... want to make sure that we support the stabilization of the economy, that means providing liquidity to make sure that the situation where people are rushing every time to look for cash is dealt with,\" Oramah said. In August, before Mugabe\\'s ouster, Afreximbank provided $600 million to help Zimbabwe pay for imports and $300 million to allow it to print more \"bond notes,\" a quasi-currency that officially trades on par with the U.S. dollar. Zimbabwe has a foreign debt of more than $7 billion and in September said it would not be able to pay $1.8 billion in arrears to the World Bank and African Development Bank until economic fundamentals improved.

The Afreximbank Trade Debt-backed Securities (AFTRADES) will be provided to participating banks as debt securities that could be used as collateral for interbank funds placements in order to promote interbank dealings among Zimbabwean Banks active in trade finance, according to the terms of a memorandum of understanding signed on by Afreximbank, the Zimbabwe Ministry of Finance and Economic Development and the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe. “Our objective is to use this facility to enable trade finance banks in Zimbabwe to access much-needed liquidity from cash-surplus banks in the country, thereby increasing their capacity to deepen their trade finance activities,” said Jean-Louis Ekra, President of Afreximbank, after signing the memorandum of understanding in Cairo on 10 February. Patrick Chinamasa, Minister of Finance and Economic Planning, and Dr. Charity L. Dhliwayo, Acting Governor of the Reserve Bank, had signed it on 31 January on behalf of the Zimbabwean parties. Mr. Ekra said that Afreximbank’s decision to introduce the facility was motivated by its recognition of the serious constraints limiting the access of Zimbabwe’s trade finance banks to funding as a result of the liquidity challenge confronting the financial sector. Under the terms of the memorandum of understanding, AFTRADES would be structured as a collateral swap involving the issuance of securities by Afreximbank to participating banks in exchange for trade–related collateral or securities presented by those banks.

Only solvent banks which are not facing fundamental problems of viability will be eligible for the facility, according to the memorandum.

The documentary trade finance training, held in Harare from 24 to 29 February, attracted 44 participants from 15 commercial banks, one non-bank financial institution and the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe. The six-day programme consisted of two three-day sessions focused on the operational aspects of trade finance. Topics covered included documentary letters of credit, bills for collection, bank guarantees, relevant International Chamber of Commerce rules, compliance issues related to trade finance and risks in international business and ways of mitigating them. Case studies of real-life scenarios were reviewed and participants were taken through a practical review session on common errors that had been noticed in trade finance instruments issued by Zimbabwean banks in order to help them learn from the errors. Based on the discussions and feedback received, the banks agreed to work towards designing a model letter of credit verbiage to cover key commodity imports. The model letter, which is expected to be endorsed by the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe, would be adopted, going forward, by all the banks. The training programme was organised in line with Afreximbank’s Trade Finance leadership pillar under which it seeks to play a leading role in matters relating to the development of trade finance in Africa, said Humphrey Nwugo, the Bank’s Regional Chief Operating Officer for Southern Africa, at the opening. “According to the World Trade Organization, some 80 per cent to 90 per cent of world trade relies on trade finance,” he told the participants. “That is the opportunity we, as trade financiers, are sitting on, with anecdotal evidence pointing to a trade finance gap in Africa in excess of $100-billion.” ')], metadata={'queries': ['Zimbabwe share of African Export Import Bank loans 2020', 'African Export Import Bank loan distribution by country 2020', 'Tendai Biti claim Zimbabwe African Export Import Bank loans', 'African Export Import Bank loans statistics 2020', 'Zimbabwe African Export Import Bank loan percentage 2020', 'Zimbabwe gets more than half of the African Export Import Bank loans.']})"
