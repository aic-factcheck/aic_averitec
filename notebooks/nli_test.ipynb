Therefore, the authors conclude, comprehensive pandemic preparations should include not only efforts to produce new or improved influenza vaccines and antiviral drugs but also provisions to stockpile antibiotics and bacterial vaccines as well.\\n\\nThe work presents complementary lines of evidence from the fields of pathology and history of medicine to support this conclusion. \"The weight of evidence we examined from both historical and modern analyses of the 1918 influenza pandemic favors a scenario in which viral damage followed by bacterial pneumonia led to the vast majority of deaths,\" says co-author NIAID Director Anthony S.

Measures of excess deaths have been used to estimate the impact of public health pandemics or disasters, particularly when there are questions about underascertainment of deaths directly attributable to a given event or cause (1–6).† Excess deaths are defined as the number of persons who have died from all causes, in excess of the expected number of deaths for a given place and time. This report describes trends and demographic patterns in excess deaths during January 26–October 3, 2020. Expected numbers of deaths were estimated using overdispersed Poisson regression models with spline terms to account for seasonal patterns, using provisional mortality data from CDC’s National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) (7). Weekly numbers of deaths by age group and race/ethnicity were assessed to examine the difference between the weekly number of deaths occurring in 2020 and the average number occurring in the same week during 2015–2019 and the percentage change in 2020. Overall, an estimated 299,028 excess deaths have occurred in the United States from late January through October 3, 2020, with two thirds of these attributed to COVID-19. The largest percentage increases were seen among adults aged 25–44 years and among Hispanic or Latino (Hispanic) persons. These results provide information about the degree to which COVID-19 deaths might be underascertained and inform efforts to prevent mortality directly or indirectly associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, such as efforts to minimize disruptions to health care.\\n\\nEstimates of excess deaths can provide a comprehensive account of mortality related to the COVID-19 pandemic, including deaths that are directly or indirectly attributable to COVID-19. Estimates of the numbers of deaths directly attributable to COVID-19 might be limi'}, {'question': 'Why is  lockdown directly attributed to COVID-19 which were observed in 2020 ?', 'answer': 'Based on NVSS data, excess deaths have occurred every week in the United States since March 2020. An estimated 299,028 more persons than expected have died since January 26, 2020; approximately two thirds of these deaths were attributed to COVID-19. A recent analysis of excess deaths from March through July reported very similar findings, but that study did not include more recent data through September (5).\\n\\nAlthough more excess deaths have occurred among older age groups, relative to past years, adults aged 25–44 years have experienced the largest average percentage increase in the number of deaths from all causes from late January through October 3, 2020. The age distribution of COVID-19 deaths shifted toward younger age groups from May through August (9); however, these disproportionate increases might also be related to underlying trends in other causes of death. Future analyses might shed light on the extent to which increases among younger age groups are driven by COVID-19 or by other causes of death. Among racial and ethnic groups, the smallest average percentage increase in numbers of deaths compared with previous years occurred among White persons (11.9%) and the largest for Hispanic persons (53.6%), with intermediate increases (28.9%–36.6%) among AI/AN, Black, and Asian persons. These disproportionate increases among certain racial and ethnic groups are consistent with noted disparities in COVID-19 mortality.***\\n\\nThe findings in this report are subject to at least five limitations. First, the weighting of provisional NVSS mortality data might not fully account for reporting lags, particularly in recent weeks. Estimated numbers of deaths in the most recent weeks are likely underestimated and will increase as more data become available. Second, there is uncertainty associated with the models used to generate the expected numbers of deaths in a given week.

For an average healthy person wearing a cloth or surgical mask, there is even less risk of these symptoms occurring, because they still allow oxygen to flow out of the mouth and nose freely.\\n\\nWhile it might feel like breathing is more difficult in a mask and you are not getting enough air, that is likely a response to stress or anxiety from wearing the mask and can usually be helped by focusing on normal breathing patterns. Shallow breathing, hyperventilation, and breath holding can cause increases in carbon dioxide which leads to headaches and nausea. These symptoms are generally not caused by the use of masks.'}, {'question': 'Does wearing a mask for long periods lead to CO2 intoxication ?', 'answer': \"Doctors typically refer to two distinct forms of oxygen deprivation: anoxic brain injuries occur when the brain is totally deprived of oxygen due to sudden cardiac arrest, choking, strangulation, and other sudden injuries. Hypoxic brain injuries occur when the brain receives less oxygen than it needs, but is not completely deprived of oxygen. Because the effects of the two injuries are similar, many brain experts use the terms interchangeably.\\n\\nA few seconds of oxygen deprivation won't cause lasting harm, so a child who holds his breath in frustration, a combatant choked unconscious during a Jiu-Jitsu match, and a diver who needs a few extra seconds to come up for air are unlikely to experience brain damage. The precise timeline of anoxic brain injuries depends on a number of personal idiosyncrasies, including overall brain and cardiovascular health, as well as the level of blood oxygenation at the time of injury. Generally speaking, injuries begin at the one-minute mark, steadily worsening thereafter.\\nHow Long Can the Brain Go Without Oxygen? A Timeline\\n\\n    Between 30-180 seconds of oxygen deprivation, you may lose consciousness.\\n    At the one-minute mark, brain cells begin dying.\\n    At three minutes, neurons suffer more extensive damage, and lasting brain damage becomes more likely.\\n    At five minutes, death becomes imminent.\\n    At 10 minutes, even if the brain remains alive, a coma and lasting brain damage are almost inevitable.\\n    At 15 minutes, survival becomes nearly impossible.\\n\\nThere are, of course, exceptions to every rule. Some training routines help the body make more efficient use of oxygen, enabling the brain to go longer periods without this vital element. Free divers routinely train to go long periods without oxygen, and the current record holder, Aleix Segura held his breath for 24 minutes and 3 seconds without sustaining brain damage!\"}]}, {'claim': 'Carbon dioxide intoxication is caused by wearing face masks.', 'evidence': [{'question': 'Does wearing a mask lower Blood oxygen saturation levels?', 'answer': 'pulse oximetry showed no major changes in oxygen saturation.'}, {'question': 'Do CO2 levels in the blood increase when wearing a mask?', 'answer': 'no major changes in end-tidal CO2 or  CO2\\nretention'}]}, {'claim': 'Wearing face masks leads to permanent neurological damage, especially in children.', 'evidence': [{'question': 'Can wearing masks cause neurological damage?', 'answer': '“The prolonged use of medical masks can be uncomfortable.

Decider was there in Park City for the screening, and our Senior Film Reporter Anna Menta filed a review of Cuties, calling it a “coming-of-age film that will speak volumes to anyone who has lived through the agonizingly confusing time that is girlhood.”\\n\\nEarlier this week, Netflix announced the premiere date of Cuties (September 9) and released the trailer for the film, which immediately set off a firestorm of criticism from hordes of angry keyboard warriors —most of whom, we assume, have yet to actually see the movie— who found some fresh ammunition for the culture wars.

Combining that term with the precocious age of the film’s primary protagonist, an 11-year-old girl, left the rabid (and scarily thriving) QAnon community foaming at the mouth; it was the cultural equivalent of throwing red meat to Joe Exotic’s menagerie of underfed tigers.

His plan would make the electricity sector free of carbon pollution by 2035; make all new U.S.-made buses zero-emissions by 2030; set a goal for disadvantaged communities to receive 40% of benefits from \"clean energy\" and infrastructure spending; and create a net-zero emissions standard for all new commercial buildings by 2030. \\n\\nBiden is aiming to move toward a less carbon-intensive economy by creating millions of jobs to help reshape the country’s energy, transportation and infrastructure sectors, with workers being able to join unions and collectively bargain.'}, {'question': 'What is the Green New Deal?', 'answer': 'The Democratic debate over environmental issues has centered heavily around the Green New Deal, a plan to rapidly switch to clean energy to head off the worst projected effects of climate change.\\n\\nHowever, unlike other ideas that Democrats are discussing on the campaign trail, the Green New Deal is not a clear policy proposal in and of itself. Instead, it refers to a 14-page resolution sponsored by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and Sen. Edward Markey, D-Mass., that lays out a series of broad goals and guiding principles and then leaves it to lawmakers to figure out how to meet them.\\n\\nThe resolution calls for “a new national, social, industrial and economic mobilization on a scale not seen since World War II and the New Deal,” one that over 10 years would move to renewable energy for electricity, and make transportation, housing, agriculture and manufacturing more energy-efficient. The goal is to create millions of new jobs in clean energy and get to net-zero emissions by 2050, not only in the United States, but around the world.'}, {'question': 'Which presidential candidates are proposing the Green New Deal?', 'answer': \"Among the candidates who have put out plans along these lines are former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Sen. Kamala Harris of California, Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, former Rep. Beto O’Rourke, and businessman Andrew Yang.\\n\\nThe plans differ in scale. Sander's, the largest by far, proposes $16 trillion in spending, paid for in part by fees on fossil fuel companies. Warren's plan calls for $3 trillion in federal investment over ten years, Biden calls for $1.7 trillion, and O'Rourke calls for $1.5 trillion, and they predict their plans would mobilize even larger contributions from the private sector.\"}, {'question': 'Will the Green New Deal ban animal agriculture?', 'answer': 'There is no mention of banning animal agriculture.'}, {'question': 'Will the Green New Deal eliminate gas-powered cars?', 'answer': \"The rise of electric vehicles, however, doesn't automatically mean the end of the reign of the gas-powered car.\"}, {'question': \"How does Joe Biden's plan differ from the Green New Deal?\", 'answer': 'One difference between Biden’s original climate plan and his new one is the cost. The original plan would have invested $1.7 trillion over 10 years, while this plan proposes spending $300 billion more than that over a shorter period of time. \\n\\n\"All of those are sort of estimates that require a ton of assumptions, and the estimates are only as good as the assumptions you put in,\" Gross said. \\n\\nBiden plans to pay for this by raising the corporate income tax rate, increasing taxes on wealthy Americans and using stimulus money.\\n\\nThe original plan did not include the goal to achieve a carbon-free pollution power sector by 2035. In addition, the new plan includes a proposal to create an Environmental and Climate Justice Division within the Justice Department. That idea was previously proposed by Democratic Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, who made climate change central to his presidential bid. Inslee supports Biden’s new approach.'}]}, {'claim': 'Joe Biden is for open borders, sanctuary cities, free lawyers and health care for illegal immigrants.', 'evidence': [{'question': 'Did Joe Biden support open borders, sanctuary cities, free lawyers and health care for illegal immigrants in 2020?', 'answer': \"This is a mix of misleading and accurate characterizations of Biden's positions.
