National data on the environmental impacts of transport are virtually non-existent though local studies of the impacts on stormwater and air quality have been conducted in some cities (e.g. Auckland). Estimates of some transport impacts may be inferred from existing data on vehicle fleet size and composition, kilometres travelled, size of roading network and petrol and diesel consumption. National data on weather patterns, temperature, rainfall etc. are generally of high quality and go back many decades.  Data on greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere are also of high quality and go back two decades.  Data on some greenhouse gas emissions are still limited and uncertain, but estimates of carbon dioxide emissions from energy and industrial processes can be accurately calculated from economic data.

Ms Collins recently responded to a request from NZ First about her China trips under the Official Information Act but Mr Robertson said he had not seen that. Labour had asked some questions to get information in August last year and worked on it further last month. Mr Key said the Cabinet Office did not believe Ms Collins' had endorsed the products. \"The fact the company might write down something, that happens all the time. I go to lots of things where I hold up things or say oh I use your toilet paper or whatever it might be, that's not deemed to be an endorsement.\" Under Parliamentary privilege, he said the situation had echoes of former National MP Pansy Wong who resigned over allegations her husband had used Parliamentary travel perks to fly to China and did business while there - which was against the rules for the use of the perks. Ms Collins said her husband had accompanied her while on an official trip to China in 2012 but had paid for himself and was on holiday. Mr Roberston said Ms Collins had opened the Auckland office of Oravida in 2013 and Oravida donated more than $55,000 to National in 2011. He said National Party president Peter Goodfellow had met with its representatives and was also part owner of Sanfords which supplied fish products to Oravida. \"So knowing all of that, Judith Collins goes to this office and promotes the products of that company. That is a conflict of interest. Judith Collins is not above the rules.\" * Judith Collins visited Oravida in China last year. Her husband is a director. A photo of Collins was put on its website with a caption saying she endorsed its products. It is against Cabinet rules to endorse products, or do anything from which a family member may benefit. "

Her husband, David Wong Tung, is a director of Oravida and the company later put up a photo of Ms Collins claiming she had tasted and endorsed their products. It is against Cabinet Manual rules to endorse any product. Labour MP Grant Robertson said there was a perception of a conflict of interest. \"Ministers have to be up front. Perception matters.'' Ms Collins said she was not aware of the photo and would ask for it to be removed if it breached Cabinet guidelines. \"I certainly don't endorse any products other than the fact I always try and help New Zealand companies trying to export.'' Prime Minister John Key said he did not believe Ms Collins' husband's directorship of Oravida created a conflict of interest. \"It doesn't preclude her dropping in.

       "In July 2015, parliamentary privilege was used to link the export of swamp kauri to Northland and National Party donors and insiders. In Parliament, Labour's MP for Te Tai Tokerau, Kelvin Davis, asked the Government if ministers were \"aware of reports that local wood manufacturers have been refused the opportunity to buy swamp kauri from Kauri Ruakaka mill, which was formerly called Oravida, and is allegedly involved in exporting raw swamp kauri?\" One of the directors of Oravida is National MP Judith Collins' husband, David Wong-Tung. The argument is that Oravida is exporting them to China under the guise of being tables and the money is being funneled into their political affiliations which just happen to include the political party Wong-Tung's wife (Judith Collins) is a prominent member of: National. This was of course denied, and RNZ even [had to write an apology to Oravida] (https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/276363/minister-defends-trade-in-kauri-swamp-logs) at the bottom of their article, saying that they were wrong to suggest Oravida were involved in the export of illegal swamp kauri. FYI.org.nz reports that the OIA request for Judith Collins to speak to her involvement was denied. You can follow the link to see the fuckery used to avoid fulfilling the request. However, when piecing together the company's purpose as Oravida Kauri Ltd, the people involved, and the history of questionable exports, it's quite clear that a proper investigation should have been done and putting it on the shoulders of the contractor seems unfair at best. And then there's Collin's connection as a National MP, her relationship with Oravida, and the donations and connections the company and the party have formed. In September 2017, a digger damaged part of a 168km jet-fuel line which caused tens of millions of dollars in lost business and repairs, grounded dozens of flights and caused havoc on the supply chain.

It also says a perception of a conflict of interest may arise where a family member or friend of a minister could get some benefit from the ministers' actions or decisions. Ms Collins said she had told Oravida in advance that it could not use her name or photograph to endorse or promote its products and had not known about the photo on the website. She had since asked Oravida to ensure it was not claiming she endorsed it, in either English or mandarin. She had tasted the milk and said \"it was nice\" but that did not amount to an endorsement of the company. \"Shock, horror, I drink milk. I promote New Zealand milk anywhere I go. It's the finest milk in the world.\" She said Mr Robertson's claims were \"desperate\" and solely because he was trying to help Labour leader David Cunliffe escape scrutiny for his use of trusts. However, Mr Robertson claimed there was still a clear conflict of interest. \"Going to a company where her husband is a director, having a photo taken and being said to have endorsed the products fits within that conflict.\" Mr Robertson denied he had timed the allegations to detract attention from Mr Cunliffe's campaign funding.

       "Collins says Oravida visit not conflict of interest Judith Collins went on a taxpayer-funded visit to China last year. In her public role as Justice Minister, she was there to talk about our system. But she was also welcomed into a New Zealand export company that her husband has a private interest in. She says the purpose of her visit was ‚Äúto actually have a cup of tea on the way to the airport‚Äù. Ms Collins‚Äô husband, David Wong-Tung, is one of three directors of Oravida ‚Äì a milk and food export company. On its website the company referred to her as the Justice Minister. It says she recognised the company‚Äôs efforts, and ‚Äúcongratulated us on what we have achieved and encouraged us to continue‚Äù. Ms Collins also opened the company‚Äôs Auckland headquarters last year, with Mr Wong-Tung standing behind her. She says it is not an issue that she was effectively promoting the company where her husband is a director. Why isn‚Äôt this getting as much coverage as Cunliffe‚Äôs supposed betrayal of democracy? Judith Collins can‚Äôt wave her connection with her husbands company around much more than adding her name and posting photos with a promotional gulp of milk to support the product. ‚Äúa conflict may arise if people close to a minister, such as a minister‚Äôs family [‚Ä¶] might derive, or be perceived as deriving, some personal, financial, or other benefit from a decision or action by the minister‚Äù. ‚ÄúWhen accepting an invitation, a minister should inform the organisation that it may not use any photos taken of the minister at the event in a way that could be perceived as an endorsement by the minister.‚Äù There‚Äôs not really much wriggle room here is there? Nothing highlights the double standards within the media better than the difference in exposure between Cunliffe‚Äôs sins and what seems to be a Judith‚Äôs massive conflict of interest. I think why there is no coverage is the age old media bias by the owners of the sensationalism carnival ‚Äì no mystery really. Will she be crushed by the weight of her own ego ? I hope so‚Ä¶ "

       "New Zealand water could be the next big export to China and one of the companies that has just jumped in for a slice of the pie is none other than Oravida. The company is only paying a small amount to the council for the millions of litres it can take. Stone Shi and Julia Xu are the brains behind Oravida, and part of Prime Minister John Key's delegation in Beijing. They're now exporting Kiwi water to China as a premium product. \"It has been filtered for many many years, and through the filtration process it carries a lot of great minerals for bodies,\" Ms Xu says. The pair's close personal ties to Judith Collins caused a huge political controversy in 2014. They've now expanded from Scampi and milk, to water from a plant in the Bay of Plenty it bought for an undisclosed sum last year. Oravida has a consent to 146 million litres of ground water a year and the regional council says Oravida pays an annual compliance charge of around $500. Oravida markets the water at $1.60 a litre, meaning if all 146 million litres were sold it could be worth $233 million a year. \"The right to draw water is determined by the local council,\" Ms Xu says. The Prime Minister says water could be the next big thing, saying the market is \"potentially huge\". It's huge because of New Zealand's clean, green image, which Oravida is using as a key selling point. "

       "Oravida is exporting millions of litres of New Zealand water to China, and the Green Party says it is wrong that they are paying practically nothing for it, while potentially making hundreds of millions of dollars. Oravida pays about $500 a year to draw up to 400,000 litres of water a day from the Otakiri Aquifer in Bay of Plenty. This will allow the company to take up to 146 million litres a year from the aquifer until 2026. An Bay of Plenty Regional Council spokesperson said Oravida had paid a total $1503 for the consents since 1992, and last year paid $526 in compliance costs. \"The Resource Management Act 1991 only allows the Regional Council to recover actual and reasonable costs associated with processing and managing resource consent applications to take water,\" she said. Massey University freshwater ecologist Mike Joy said the same thing will keep happening until the government charged for water. \"It's just a free for all for a tiny proportion of New Zealanders, that abuse something that belongs to all of us. Whether they be farmers polluting the water, or taking it out for irrigation, or if it's bottling companies taking it away, the core issue is that we are not putting a price on it.\" Mr Joy said charging users would dramatically improve how efficiently water was used. Greens water issues spokesperson Catherine Delahunty said it was wrong for companies like Oravida to make a profit by exporting this increasingly valuable resource. \"This is happening not only in the Bay of Plenty but all over the country. There's 74 bottling plants. But, when the water is purely for export it means we're giving away that water for nothing, when we may need it in the future.\" Hundreds of people marched in Ashburton on Saturday, protesting against the council there selling off a piece of land with the right to extract 45 litres of water a second from the town's aquifers for the next 30 years.

In many ways, the two could not be more different. Margaret Thatcher is Collins‚Äô political hero. ‚ÄúI like the fact she didn‚Äôt give up when others would have. She didn‚Äôt give in to what other people thought she should do, or be.‚Äù Collins, 61, is a famously tough, take-no-prisoners party stalwart, nicknamed ‚ÄúCrusher Collins‚Äù for her desire to destroy the cherished cars of boy racers. She is also famed for her tough stance on crime, supported the introduction of Tasers to the police force, and argued for officers to have better access to firearms. But there is another side. She is one of the more socially liberal National leaders in recent years, she loathes ‚Äúall forms of racism and sexism‚Äù, voted for the legalisation of same-sex marriage, taking abortion out of the Crimes Act, and legalising euthanasia. She is also an animal tragic who is still grieving the loss of her dog, Holly, euthanised while the country was under effective house-arrest. The leadership of the centre-right National party has eluded Collins for years, despite her evident penchant and suitability for a leadership role. On Tuesday ‚Äì when Todd Muller unexpectedly resigned after 53 days citing health reasons ‚Äì Collins claimed the top job, saying the party had decided her ‚Äústrength and decisiveness‚Äù were what the party needed so close to an election and after a slew of high-profile resignations. Collins may also be the party‚Äôs only hope against the staggering popularity of Ardern. The daughter of Waikato dairy farmers, Collins has long been a decisive political figure in New Zealand‚Äôs otherwise somewhat beige parliament, and in her 18 years in the beehive ‚Äì as the parliamentary building is known ‚Äì she has never been far from the action.

       "Long-serving politician Judith Collins will lead New Zealand's opposition National Party into an election against a popular government in just over two months, taking over from Todd Muller, who quit as leader citing health reasons. Mr Muller shocked politicians in the right-of-centre party saying he was stepping down \"effective immediately.\" The 67-year-old former business executive had led the party for only 53 days, toppling previous leader Simon Bridges in a leadership coup amid National's stagnant polling numbers. Ms Collins was chosen to take over the leadership in a hastily arranged meeting of the party's parliamentary caucus in Wellington on Tuesday evening. She is National's fourth leader in three years and its second female leader. Ms Collins was first elected to Parliament in 2002, serving in governments under prime ministers John Key and Bill English. She held police and corrections portfolios and is seen to represent the right-wing of the National Party, having previously promoted strong law and order policies. Ms Collins now faces the task of trying to rally National's support 67 days from 19 September elections at which it will try to unseat the governing Labour Party of popular Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern. Judith Collins (right) with new deputy leader Gerry Brownlee (left) at New Zealand Parliament in Wellington. Recent polls show Labour with sufficient support to form a majority government, a first since New Zealand adopted a system of proportional representation in 1996. All previous governments since that time have been coalitions and Labour currently governs with the support of the Green Party and right-of-centre New Zealand First led by Winston Peters. Mr Muller's sudden departure forced a scramble of lawmakers to Wellington during a parliamentary recess. Mr Muller said his health made his continuation in the leadership untenable. "

Other than Ardern she is one of the few New Zealand lawmakers whose first name alone would spark recognition with the public. Ben Thomas, a centre-right commentator, said that made her the party‚Äôs only choice. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs the only person in National who is assured enough and polished enough to foot it with Jacinda Ardern,‚Äù he said. Thomas added that the ‚Äúpatricians‚Äù of the party had been unable to ‚Äúgo head to head‚Äù with the prime minister, who often answers the public‚Äôs questions in Facebook Live broadcasts from home and had a 54% preferred prime minister rating in a June poll (her then-rival, Muller, held 13% support). Collins‚Äôs rise came at the end of a horror day for National; its lawmakers had been unaware of what was coming when their leader suddenly announced his resignation, ‚Äúeffective immediately‚Äù by email on Tuesday morning, saying in a statement that his leadership was ‚Äúuntenable from a health perspective‚Äù and had ‚Äútaken a heavy toll‚Äù on him personally. ‚ÄúIt has become clear to me that I am not the best person to be leader of the opposition and leader of the New Zealand National party at this critical time for New Zealand,‚Äù said Muller. ‚ÄúIt is more important than ever that the New Zealand National party has a leader who is comfortable in the role.‚Äù He has made no further comment, has not appeared in public since his resignation, and did not attend Tuesday‚Äôs meeting to select his replacement. In June, shortly after Muller assumed the leadership after ousting his predecessor, National had risen in the polls to just 38% against Labour‚Äôs 50% ‚Äì meaning Ardern‚Äôs party could govern alone.

For the first time since National‚Äôs caucus replaced Don Brash with John Key, the party has chosen a leader who can win. The new Leader of the Opposition is a clear-sighted defender of the neoliberal order who is prepared to give when she needs to give, and takes no prisoners when she doesn‚Äôt. Collins is articulate, shrewd and possesses a disarming (if somewhat cruel) sense of humour. Those on the left who dismiss her as a major electoral turn-off will, almost certainly, be proved wrong. She has what it takes to manoeuvre Jacinda and Labour onto the defensive. And, as everybody knows: explaining is losing. Like Act‚Äôs current collection of strategists, Collins understands that delivering neoliberalism straight leaves voters with a sour taste in their mouths. It goes down much better when fizzed-up with lashings of law-and-order rhetoric ‚Äì along with generous splashes of ‚Äúculture wars‚Äù liqueur. That Collins, herself, happily owns up to being a ‚Äúsocial liberal‚Äù, only adds an extra kick to her political cocktail. It‚Äôs this political ambiguity that makes National‚Äôs new leader so dangerous. Collins does not belong to the crazy Christian Right faction of her caucus, but neither is she a member of the Nikki Kaye, Amy Adams, Chris Bishop ‚Äúsoppy liberal‚Äù wing of the party. (Although she may, from time-to-time, be found voting alongside them.) For a long while now this ambiguity has constituted an unhelpful obstacle to her advancement. With the right rejecting her as too left, and the left dismissing her as too right, she has fallen repeatedly between the two stools. But now, with both factions severely discredited, being a little bit country and a little bit rock-n-roll has proved to be no bad thing at all. When pitted against Jacinda, however, it‚Äôs Collins‚Äô neoliberalism which is likely to prove most deadly. "

Collins, who has long held leadership ambitions but whose party is floundering in the polls, will face an uphill battle to persuade voters away from Ardern, one of the most popular New Zealand prime ministers of all time. Her centre-left Labour party is riding high in the polls after Ardern‚Äôs government quashed the spread of Covid-19 in the country, with many regarding the prime minister as something of a saviour figure. While Collins‚Äôs predecessor had said he would not oppose the government ‚Äúfor opposition‚Äôs sake,‚Äù her ascension sets the stage for a clash of ideologies on the campaign trail: the 61-year-old politician, who has decried the ‚Äúwoke left‚Äù, said in May that she was ‚Äúsick of being demonised‚Äù for being white. ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs important that we give credit where it‚Äôs due,‚Äù she said of Ardern at a news conference after she won a late-night vote on Tuesday. But there was ‚Äúno chance at all that I‚Äôm going to let Jacinda Ardern get away with any nonsense‚Äù. The new party leader was staunch when she took the podium, surrounded by her MPs, after National held a late-night, closed-door vote at New Zealand‚Äôs parliament in Wellington, following the shock resignation on Tuesday morning of Todd Muller. He quit abruptly after leading the party for a volatile 53 days ‚Äì the shortest stint in its history ‚Äì characterised by leaks, distractions, weak interview performances, and rogue MPs. He had ousted the previous leader, Simon Bridges in a coup in May after dismal polling showed a heavy loss for the party in September. "

Thereafter, members of the caucus stood alongside Collins and Brownlee as they addressed media. \"Third time lucky,\" Collins said, referring to the other leadership bids she's made. She said Paul Goldsmith would remain National's finance spokesperson, but couldn't confirm whether Michael Woodhouse would remain health spokesperson. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see major shifts at all in the policies we have,\" she said, stressing there wouldn‚Äôt be ‚Äúwholesale‚Äù policy changes. Collins said the caucus decision not to work with New Zealand First still stood. ‚ÄúI think we need to be very focussed on just sticking to focussing on our party vote, and understanding there are other players coming into politics at this time as well,‚Äù she said. While Muller, and his former deputy Nikki Kaye in particular, were well-placed to target centrist voters, Collins said: ‚ÄúI think it is important that we send some very strong messages out to our base voters, who have been, obviously, a bit discombobulated with the last day or so. They need to know that we‚Äôre absolutely back on track and we will be taking the fight to the Government.‚Äù Asked whether she would adopt the same approach Muller said he would - to not be in ‚Äúopposition for opposition‚Äôs sake‚Äù, Collins responded: ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs important that we give credit where it‚Äôs due, but at the same time there is no chance at all that I‚Äôm going to let Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern get away with any nonsense when it comes to our economy and doing her job.

       "An eye-watering $31 billion is the price tag National has put on the infrastructure upgrade required to fix the country's transport network and Auckland and upper North Island's congestion crisis. In her first big policy announcement today, new National leader Judith Collins delivered the opposition's infrastructure plan - a policy former leader Todd Muller was meant to make before quitting on Tuesday. Collins has also announced a National government would repeal the Resource Management Act completely, and replace it with two new pieces of law. More than half of the money announced by Collins today ($17b) would be invested in the upper north, which Collins said was home to half of all New Zealanders. To fix the congestion issues, Collins announced \"National would go ahead with everything Labour has said it will do in transport\" - with the exception of Transport Minister Phil Twyford's \"light-rail Ghost Trains, and the probable exception of the $360 million Skypath 2\". She said National would also go much further, with some work beginning immediately and the larger projects rolled out over the next decade. One of the most ambitious projects announced was four-lane expressways - including tunnels under the Brynderwyn and Kaimai mountain ranges - to connect WhangƒÅrei, Auckland, Hamilton and Tauranga. \"National's vision is to transform the four cities to be one economic powerhouse, unlocking their potential so the upper North Island becomes Australasia's most dynamic region,'' Collins said. Also part of the announcement is Auckland's rapid transit network, including rail to the airport and new busways. \"One rough definition of a city is that it is a place you can get from one side to the other in an hour, or a place that the average time to get to work is 30 minutes. National will measure our progress against the goals of 30 minutes to get to work and one hour to get across the city,'' Collins said. "

       "I‚Äôve seen a couple of recent political commentaries comparing National‚Äôs new leader Judith Collins to the late former Prime Minister Robert Muldoon who dominated New Zealand politics from the mid 1970‚Äôs to the mid 1980‚Äôs. Certainly the little bit of the first exchange in the house I caught between Collins and P.M. Ardern invites the comparison in the pugnacious political style the new Opposition Leader is projecting. There is also more than an element of the ‚ÄúThink Big ‚Äú project of the Muldoon era in Collins‚Äô plan to bypass the Resource Management Act for huge infrastructure projects such as the proposed four-lane highway from Whangarei to Tauranga and a second Auckland harbour crossing. The idea that you just bulldoze any legislation designed to protect our environment out of the way in the name ‚Äúprogress‚Äù is very Muldoon at his draconian worst. Most Acts of Parliament require review from time to time and the RMA is no exception . Moreover, in my view, Transport is certainly one of those areas where Labour is weakest and therefore most vulnerable to attack from the Right. It does seem to me however, as we watch the issue of traffic congestion especially in Auckland and Wellington being debated in the run up to the election, that we need to think about whether more cars on our roads (be they petrol driven or electric) is really such a great idea. Or whether a radical rethink about how we get from A to B ‚Äì eg. completely free, highly efficient bus, light rail and train services ‚Äì is in order As for Muldoon. I interviewed him on two occasions. He was a highly divisive politician who rolled the job of Finance Minister into that of the Prime Minister and became drunk on power. But, he was something Judith Collins and her current National Party colleagues are not. He was anti-neoliberal. He rejected Treasury‚Äôs advice to follow the economic path of self-centeredness being advocated by Britain‚Äôs then Conservative Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and Republican President Ronald Regan.

       "He is marked down because people do not warm to the way he comes across. Who is to say that they would warm to another leader who was even more aggressive and lacking in charm? There are many qualities other than aggression that voters seek ‚Äì as Jacinda Ardern‚Äôs popularity demonstrates. A leader of the Opposition who was able to mix it in a roughhouse could still be seen as lacking the poise and judgment that would be needed in a Prime Minister. We should never forget that what makes the job of leading the Opposition so difficult is that the holder of that office must be seen not only as an effective and combative critic of the government but also as a potential Prime Minister. It is here that the case for a Judith Collins leadership really starts to crumble. We now know enough about her to doubt whether she is an appropriate, let alone credible, candidate for the top job. A simple rehearsal of some of the high (or perhaps that should be low) points of her political career should be enough to confirm those doubts. Her close relationship with Cameron Slater ‚Äì he of ‚ÄúDirty Politics‚Äù fame ‚Äì should ring the alarm bells; Cameron Slater regards her as his mentor in the black arts and has said as much. Her refusal to recognise the conflict of interest implicit in a dinner with her husband‚Äôs firm, Oravida, when on a taxpayer-paid ministerial visit to China was compounded by the misinformation she offered to explain the visit she paid to its offices ‚Äì it was, she said, simply for a ‚Äúcup of tea on the way to the airport‚Äù, when the airport was actually in the opposite direction. These malfeasances obliged both the Speaker and John Key, when Prime Minister, to reprimand her and stand her down. These elements strongly suggest that what might be seen by her supporters as a commendable willingness to cut corners and to ‚Äúget down and dirty‚Äù should actually disqualify her from offering herself as a potential Prime Minister.

       "Judith Collins is the new leader of National after the party accepted Todd Muller's resignation and backed her to take over on Tuesday. It's been a tumultuous road to the helm for Collins, a role she's put herself forward for twice before - one fraught with resignations, troublesome tweets and Dirty Politics. But she's arrived now, and believes there are no skeletons left in the closet. \"If anyone's gone through having all their emails gone through, all their phone records and everything else for years‚Ä¶ I think we're perfectly fine,\" she told Magic Talk on Wednesday. \"If someone wants to try something, fine. I'm ready for them. I'm focused on the people of New Zealand, I'm not worrying about the sort of muckrakers we've dealt with in the past.\" Need a reminder of what Collins has dished up in the past? Below are the biggest controversies of her political career. Judith Collins was accused in 2014 of a conflict of interest with Oravida bosses - a company where her husband was a director - and a Chinese official. During a taxpayer-funded visit to China in her role as Justice Minister in 2013, Collins was welcomed into the New Zealand export company and endorsed the milk it produced. Prime Minister John Key criticised the visit, causing Collins to apologise. However she said the Chinese official - who she refused to name - was a \"very close personal friend\". She also claimed it was \"not necessarily true\" that her husband would benefit financially from the company doing well, as he wasn't a shareholder. Key told media Collins was on her final warning over the incident - but she maintained she had Key's permission to meet with the company. Also in 2014, Collins found herself embroiled in the scandal sparked by Nicky Hager's Dirty Politics - an explosive book that had an entire chapter devoted to her alleged unscrupulous tactics. "
