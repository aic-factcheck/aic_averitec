President Obama demonstrated to all of us, as well as the public, his immense capability as a public communicator. In many, many ways he said exactly the kinds of things we need to be discussing with each other if we're going to get America back on track. President Obama urged all of us to reach out in as much bipartisanship, nonpartisanship as possible to make sure that we stimulate our economy, create jobs, leading America to a new opportunity in the years ahead.

An alternative term used in the sanitation sector for disinfection of waste streams, sewage sludge or fecal sludge is sanitisation or sanitization.[citation needed] The Australian Therapeutic Goods Order No. 54 defines several grades of disinfectant as will be used below.[13] Sterilant means a chemical agent which is used to sterilize critical medical devices or medical instruments. A sterilant kills all micro-organisms with the result that the sterility assurance level of a microbial survivor is less than 10^-6. Sterilant gases are not within this scope.[citation needed] Low level disinfectant means a disinfectant that rapidly kills most vegetative bacteria as well as medium-sized lipid containing viruses, when used according to labelling. It cannot be relied upon to destroy, within a practical period, bacterial endospores, mycobacteria, fungi, or all small nonlipid viruses.[citation needed] Intermediate level disinfectant means a disinfectant that kills all microbial pathogens except bacterial endospores, when used as recommended by the manufacturer. It is bactericidal, tuberculocidal, fungicidal (against asexual spores but not necessarily dried chlamydospores or sexual spores), and virucidal.[citation needed] High level disinfectant means a disinfectant that kills all microbial pathogens, except large numbers of bacterial endospores when used as recommended by its manufacturer. - a disinfectant which is used to reprocess reusable therapeutic devices; and - when associated with the words ‚Äúlow‚Äù, ‚Äúintermediate‚Äù or ‚Äúhigh‚Äù means ‚Äúlow‚Äù, ‚Äúintermediate‚Äù or ‚Äúhigh‚Äù level disinfectant respectively. \n"

A consultation with a nurse who specializes in wound, ostomy, and continence care (WOC nurse) or an ostomy support group may be helpful both before and after surgery. Cancer of the kidney is among the 10 most common cancers in both men and w omen. The ACS (2013) estimates about 65,150 new cases of kidney cancer will occur in 2013. The lifetime risk of kidney cancer is 1 in 63. Risk factors include genetics, smoking, obesity, hypertension, years of kidne y dialysis, and exposure to radiation, asbestos, and industrial pollution. Most patients with kidney cancer are over age 55. It is rare under the age of 45. Men ha ve twice the incidence of women. Often the cancer has metastasized before it is   diagnosed because the kidney has such a large volume of cir- culating blood, which increases the risk of tumor spread. In The three classic symptoms of kidney cancer are hematuria, dull pain in the flank area, and a mass in the area. Often, symptoms of kidney cancer do not occur until the tumor in- vades surrounding tissue. Less specif ic symptoms include fever, weight loss, night sweats, hypertension, anemia, poly- cythemia, swelling in the legs, fatigue, anorexia, and consti- pation. Symptoms of metastasis may be the first evidence of kidney cancer and include weight loss, cough, bone fractures, A number of diagnostic tests will be done, including an IV pyelogram, cystoscopy and pyelogram, ultrasound examina- tion of the kidneys, CT scans of the abdomen, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A definitive diagnosis is made Surgery is the commonly used treatment for cancer of the kid- ney. A radical nephrectomy removes the entire kidney along with the adrenal gland and other surrounding structures, in- cluding fascia, fat, and lymph nodes, in the area.

Recommendations for a regular program of maintenance and disinfection have been published.866‚Äì869  Health-care facilities are advised to clean ice-storage chests on a regular basis. Open ice chests may require a more frequent cleaning schedule compared with chests that have covers.

Ice-making machines may require less frequent cleaning, but their maintenance is important to proper performance. The manufacturer‚Äôs instructions for both the proper method of cleaning and/or maintenance should be followed. These instructions may also recommend an EPA-registered disinfectant to ensure chemical potency, materials compatibility, and safety. In the event that instructions and suitable EPA-registered disinfectants are not available for this process, then a generic approach to cleaning, disinfecting, and maintaining ice machines and dispensers can be used (Box 12).

      "In a SARS trial of 80 patients, administration of convalescent plasma within 14 days of onset of illness was associated with a better outcome compared with treatment later in the course of their illness. This suggests that convalescent plasma would be more likely to be effective early after infection or appearance of symptoms. Is there any experience with plasma therapy in the current COVID-19 epidemic? A recent report from JAMA describes five critically ill, mechanically ventilated patients in China with COVID-19 who received convalescent plasma. These patients‚Äô clinical improvement was associated with receipt of the plasma but no conclusions can be drawn regarding the efficacy of the approach. What are the considerations or risks of therapeutic convalescent plasma? Given past experiences, the high mortality rate in critically ill patients with COVID-19, and the absence to date of any proven effective therapies, the use of convalescent COVID-19 plasma is a very reasonable approach to consider. However, this therapy must be done with the utmost care, a difficult task in the midst of a pandemic. The FDA emphasizes the need for clinical trials: \"Although promising, convalescent plasma has not been shown to be effective in every disease studied. It is therefore important to determine through clinical trials, before routinely administering convalescent plasma to patients with COVID-19, that it is safe and effective to do so.‚Äù In response to the national emergency, the National COVID-19 Convalescent Plasma Project was established on March 24, 2020 to provide information to: Health care providers who are considering using convalescent plasma to treat patients, either outside of a trial or in the context of a randomized trial Patients who have recovered from COVID-19 infection and are willing to donate plasma Patients with any stage of COVID-19 (or their families) who are considering this treatment \n"

      "He distinguishes between traditional, new, and emerging political dynasties with the 3 national legislature as the ‚Äúnexus for national and local power dynamics, the mechanism by which political clans acquire, sustain, and reproduce power.‚Äù In his chapter on congressional ‚Äúpork barrel,‚Äù Ronald D. Holmes provides an overview of a hundred years of national patronage politics in the Philippines before analyzing this phenomenon in the post-Marcos era. In elections, pork barrel allows incumbent politicians to target voters by directing pork funds to their constituencies. But politicians also regularly siphon off funds for direct use in their campaign in order to ‚Äúmaintain a clientelistic network by dispensing various forms of assistance finance by such funds, or for personal enrichment.‚Äù Finally the pressure for ‚Äúpork‚Äù means that all post-Marcos presidents must yield to legislators‚Äô demands for particularistic projects in order to secure Congressional support for their preferred legislative programs. In their chapter on the Philippine Congress, Diana J. Mendoza and Mark R. Thompson suggest that the national legislature is largely subordinated to the president due in part to its reliance on patronage distributed by the chief executive as well as the lack of programmatic political parties. The overwhelmingly elite character of representatives and senators contributes to its reactive character, aimed at protecting the oligarchy‚Äôs interest rather than passing innovative legislation. Yet Congress does have some tools with which to challenge presidents: congressional oversight hearings, impeachment/conviction, and other powers. It also has occasionally passed landmark legislation, particularly in areas of gender equality thanks in part to the successful efforts of the women‚Äôs movement. The chapter on the presidency by Mark R. Thompson picks up on the debate about the role of clientelist politics and pork barrel in the post-Marcos Philippines. \n"

Totals for policy characteristics will differ due to studies being classified under more than one category, or due to studies not reporting on all characteristics. As some articles did not report on all descriptive categories, the following proportions are from those reported. The term intervention will be used to refer to both policies and programmes. Articles were categorized into four intervention types, (1) input support, (2) output support/restriction, (3) technical support, and (4) financial support. Fifty-four studies assessed production. Of these studies 10 collected primary data through surverys and interviews, 10 studies used both primary and secondary data and the remaining 34 studies analyzing secondary data. The articles identified in this scoping review assessed a wide range of outcomes. We categorized the outcomes for clarity. The remaining articles assessed land allocation (n = 25) (e.g., crop diversification, acreage expansion), efficiency (n = 23), rates of employment including on- and off-farm employment (n = 18), and farm income (n = 17). Other outcomes were measured, such as exports, production costs, economic growth, and number of farms, each composing less than 5% of the included studies, but together composing 13% (n = 20) of the total. Crops targeted by a policy at times differed from crops targeted by the study. The agricultural product most used to evaluate a policy were cereal crops (37%, n = 39), followed by oilseed crops (8%, n = 8), livestock (8%, n = 9), and dairy (8%, n = 9). Less common were agricultural commodities such as fruits, vegetables, and legumes (e.g., beans, pulses) each comprising less then 5% of the studies but together represented 39% (n = 41) of the total.

He lives directly across the street from my house. 4 of the cars he owned or still owns didnt function at all. But so he kept these cars on both sides of my driveway  for months. He was asked nicely if we here at my  residence could park next to our driveway. Just once space not both sides of driveway but just one.  He agreed but left the cars where they were and after a week went by he managed to move the car  and then he put another non functioning car in its place he left it for 13 days maybe 14 days ... then \n"

      "In 1982, the federal government funded a ‚ÄúPolice Services Study,‚Äù in which 12,022 randomly selected citizens were interviewed in three metropolitan areas. The study found that 13.6 percent of those surveyed had cause to complain about police service in the previous year (this included verbal abuse and discourtesy, as well as physical force). Yet, only 30 percent of the people filed formal complaints. In other words, most instances of police abuse go unreported. Community activists, take note: Your local police department or local news media may produce official figures showing a low rate of alleged abuse, but those figures do not reflect unreported incidents. Moreover, a low overall rate masks the higher rate of abuse suffered by poor men ‚Äî poor men of color in particular. Obtaining the most relevant information on the activities of your police department can be a tough task. That‚Äôs the first thing to bear in mind about the ‚Äúhomework‚Äù community residents have to do in order to build a strong case for reform. In answer to critics, police chiefs often cite various official data to support their claim that they are really doing a great job. ‚ÄúLook at the crime rate,‚Äù they say. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs lower than in other cities.‚Äù Or: ‚ÄúMy department‚Äôs arrest rate is much higher than elsewhere.‚Äù The catch is that these data, though readily available to citizens, are deeply flawed, while the most important information is not always easy to get. Forget the ‚Äúcrime rate.‚Äù The ‚Äúcrime rate‚Äù figures cited by government officials are based on the FBI‚Äôs Uniform Crime Reports (UCR) system, which has several serious flaws. To name only a few: First, the UCR only measures reported crime. Second, since the system is not independently audited there are no meaningful controls over how police departments use their crime data. Police officers can and do ‚Äúunfound‚Äù crimes, meaning they decide that no crime occurred. They also ‚Äúdowngrade‚Äù crimes ‚Äî for example, by officially classifying a rape as an assault. \n"

The epidemiologic triangle recognizes three major factors‚Äîagent, environment, and host‚Äîin the pathogenesis of disease.

Methods for investigation and control of epidemics also include examination of agent, host, and environment factors.

Entrepreneurship support in higher education generally has two strands. The first strand  aims at developing entrepreneurial mindsets. It stresses the development of such traits as  self efficacy, creativity, risk awareness, building and managing relationships. The second  strand aims to build the attitudes, skills and knowledge needed to successfully launch and  In recent years, the frequent use of business plans to teach entrepreneurship courses  has been complemented by greater involvement of entrepreneurs in the teaching process, as  well as an increasing use of social media and massive open online courses. It is increasingly  common to find classrooms in which students are challenged to identify and use a wider  range of knowledge sources to find novel solutions. Today, more than ever, schools and universities are expected to respond to the social  and economic needs of society, such as facilitating graduate employability, contributing to  economic growth and local development, assisting innovation, and stimulating the birth of  new enterprises. In this connection, HEInnovate (www.heinnovate.eu) ‚Äì a joint initiative of the  OECD and the European Commission ‚Äì is a tool to help higher education institutions identify  and act on opportunities for capacity development, including in teaching and research to  enhance innovation and entrepreneurship (Box 1.6). Entrepreneurship education also faces a gender challenge. The OECD (2012) has found  that across OECD countries there are more male than female entrepreneurs, and the share  of women who choose to run a business has not increased substantially in most countries.  If women‚Äôs intentions to engage in entrepreneurship are constrained by gender-specific  conditions, society and the economy will fail to maximise their entrepreneurial potential.  \n"

Many of them are capable of causing dangerous epidemics.‚Äù The term reemerging infections refers to ‚Äú‚Ä¶ certain ‚Äòold‚Äô diseases, such as tuberculosis and syphilis, that have experienced a resurgence because of a changed host-agent-environment conditions.‚Äù35(p 85) Examples of emerging diseases are HIV/AIDS, hepatitis C virus infections, Lyme disease, E. coli O157:H7 foodborne illnesses, and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome. Many emerging infections are not caused by sudden mutations in a pathogen; instead they appear when an existing pathogen gains access to new host populations. Changes in climate, human activities such as farming or reforestation, technologic changes such as air travel and organ transplantation, and demographic changes such as migration to cities may all contribute to the emergence of seemingly new and deadly infections. Other potential sources of infection are bush meat (meat obtained by hunting wildlife) and companion animals (cats and dogs; pet rats).36 For example, from time to time cats are associated with the transmission of toxoplasmosis. \n"

The Committee  observes that the complainant organization has not provided the further information that the  Committee had asked it to present in support of its allegations of a transfer on anti-union  grounds. The Committee considers it useful to recall once again that one of the fundamental  principles of freedom of association is that workers should enjoy adequate protection  against all acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of their employment, such as  dismissal, demotion, transfer or other prejudicial measures. This protection is particularly  desirable in the case of trade union officials because, in order to be able to perform their  trade union duties in full independence, they should have a guarantee that they will not be  prejudiced on account of the mandate which they hold from their trade unions. The  Committee has considered that the guarantee of such protection in the case of trade union  officials is also necessary in order to ensure that effect is given to the fundamental principle  that workers‚Äô organizations shall have the right to elect their representatives in full freedom  [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth  772.

Three dozen regulars‚Äîalmost all of them women‚Äîfiled into the church basement. Some grabbed ‚Äúcuts‚Äù of pizza from the front of the room; a few lingered in the cold for one last smoke. As the clock approached 6:00, they settled into metal folding chairs, spread out their game sheets, and focused on the numbers. The entire political world, in turn, has been focused on these women and the numbers‚Äîand potential power‚Äîthey represent. The bingo players are part of the white working class, a prized group that helped elect Donald Trump in 2016. Many are Democrats who supported Barack Obama in one or both of his races and had never pulled the GOP lever before. To Republicans they represent the path to the president‚Äôs reelection. To Democrats they personify opportunity, a chance to siphon off just enough Trump votes in swing states to remove him from office. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need to win them,‚Äù said Democratic pollster Jill Normington. ‚ÄúI need to lose by less.‚Äù \n"

      "achievement of the ends must progress at a rate that allows all the players to go from what is to what should be‚Äîoften step by step with a little progress each time. Patience, policy, cooperation, progress, and payoff are functional partners. Payoffs, including profits, usually come more easily to organizations that define useful and progressively achievable purposes and then attain them. Linking policy, planning, and desired payoffs seems a sensible way to operate an organization. By simply adding a positive societal impact to its current focus, an organization would be taking the stereotypical ‚Äúexcellence‚Äù approach (with its major concern about how to improve on ‚Äúwhat is‚Äù). Ingenuity often achieves success by proactive and creative innovation. Therefore, organizations should continue to create a useful ‚Äúwhat should If an organization wants to develop a better tomorrow for itself, its workers, and the world, its policies, planning, development, implementation, and evaluation must include all elements of concern (see Table 1) for the twin dimensions of ‚Äúwhat is‚Äù and ‚Äúwhat should be‚Äù (Kaufman, 1982; Kaufman & Stone, 1983). A holistic perspective would include that which the organization uses (inputs), what which it does (processes), its en route or building-block accomplishments (products), the results that it delivers to clients (outputs), and the impact for clients and society (outcomes). Together, these five components form the organizational elements; when used with the dimensions of what is and what should be, they allow an organization to orchestrate and link its efforts, By seeking ways to measure societal impact, however imperfect initially, an organization will be able to provide a better target for defining and following its North Star. The basic criteria for positive societal impact is that each person be self-sufficient and self-reliant, not under the care or control of another person or agent, and not addicted to other people or agencies (Kaufman & Carron, 1980).

Alaska Court System Structure and Flow of Civil and Criminal Appeals As provided by Article IV, section 16 of the Constitution of Alaska, the Alaska Supreme Court appoints an administrative director to supervise the administrative operations of the judicial system. Stacey Marz has been the administrative director since November, 2019. Ms. Marz is assisted by employees in the administrative office of the court who have statewide responsibilities regarding human resources, fiscal operations, information management, facilities, and special projects. The specific responsibilities of the administrative director and the administrative office are outlined in Rule 1 of the Alaska Court System Rules of Administration. These include supervising the administrative operations of the court and advising the chief justice and the Supreme Court in all matters not adjudicatory in nature. - Alternative Dispute Resolution Projects Coordination - Education of Judicial Officers and Clerks of Court - Fiscal Operations (including Accounting, Supply, Print Shop, Micrographics and Procurement) This introductory profile discusses the roles of justices, judges and magistrate judges in the court system. However, many persons who are not part of the court system are involved with the larger justice system. - A plaintiff is the person (or group, or corporation, etc.) who first brings a case to court and starts the court action. - A defendant is the person (or group, or corporation, etc.) who is on the other side of the dispute that the plaintiff has brought to court. - A peace officer or law enforcement officer (for example, a police officer or state trooper) is a person who is responsible for maintaining order, enforcing the law, and preventing and detecting crime. \n"

      "extremists, particularly in conflict zones. Sunni violent extremist groups are increasingly joining or initiating insurgencies to advance their local and transnational objectives. Many of these groups are increasingly capable of conducting effective insurgent campaigns, given their membership growth and  accumulation of large financial and materiel caches. This trend increasingly blurs the lines between insurgent and terrorist groups as both aid local fighters, leverage safe havens, and pursue attacks against No single paradigm explains how terrorists become involved in insurgencies. Some groups like ISIL in Syria and al-Qa‚Äôida in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) in Mali have worked with local militants to incite insurgencies. Others, like Boko Haram, are the sole instigators and represent the primary threat to their respective homeland‚Äôs security. Still others, including al-Shabaab, are the primary beneficiaries of an insurgency started by others. Finally, other groups, such as core al-Qa‚Äòida, have taken advantage of the relative safe haven in areas controlled by insurgent groups to build capabilities and alliances without taking on a primary leadership role in the local conflict.  Although al-Qa‚Äòida‚Äôs presence in Afghanistan and Pakistan has been significantly degraded, it aspires to attack the US and its allies. In Yemen, the proven capability of AQAP to advance external plots during periods of instability suggests that leadership losses and challenges from the Iranian-backed Huthi  insurgency will not deter its efforts to strike the West. Amid this conflict, AQAP has made territorial gains in Yemen including the seizure of military bases in the country‚Äôs largest province. Al-Qa‚Äôida nodes in Syria, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Turkey are also dedicating resources to planning attacks. Al-Shabaab, al-Qaida's affiliate in East Africa, continues its violent insurgency in southern and central Somalia despite losses of territory and influence and conflict among senior leaders.  \n"

      "In order to place recent homeownership trends in context, it is helpful first to examine changes in  homeownership over a longer time period.  Exhibit 3-1 presents homeownership rates by race for ten- year intervals beginning in 1940.49  Over the two decades following 1940 the nation saw an  unprecedented rise in homeownership rates, with the overall homeownership rate rising by more than  18 percentage points, from 43.6 percent to 61.9 percent. All racial groups contributed to this rise as the white homeownership rate rose by 17.7 points (from 45.6 percent to 64.3 percent), the black rate rose by 15.3 points (from 22.8 percent to 38.1 percent), and the Asian rate rose by 27.8 points (from 16.3 percent to 44.1 percent).50  Homeownership rates generally continued to rise between 1960  and1980, but at a more modest pace.  During this period gains among minorities generally outpaced  gains among whites. The white rate increased by 4.2 points, while the black rate rose by 7.2 points The 1980s were notable as a period when the post-War boom in homeownership came to an end.   Over the decade the overall homeownership rate actually declined by 0.2 points. This overall decline was composed of a small rise in the white homeownership rate of 0.5 points coupled with declines  among all minority groups: 1.4 points among blacks, 1.0 points among Hispanics, and 0.1 points  among Asians.  The gains made in homeownership during the 1990s seemed all the more dramatic  against this recent history of stagnating and declining homeownership rates.  Between 1990 and 2000  the overall homeownership rate increased by 2.0 percentage points, including increases of 3.3 points for whites, 2.4 points for blacks, 2.2 points for Asians, and 3.0 points for Hispanics.                                                           49  One challenge of presenting data on homeownership trends is that there are several different sources of data on homeownership rates, which present some non-trivial differences in homeownership levels and trends. \n"

Their work focused on  the intersection of communities and their material environments, high- lighting the urgency of urban environmental concerns. While reform movements focused their attention on the urban poor,  other efforts targeted rural communities. The Country Life movement,  spearheaded by Liberty Hyde Bailey, sought to support agrarian fami- lies and encourage young people to stay in their communities and run  family farms.

The  extinction of the North American passenger pigeon reveals the complex- ity of Progressive Era relationships between people and nature. Passenger  pigeons were actively hunted, prepared at New York‚Äôs finest restaurants  and in the humblest of farm kitchens. Some hunted them for pay; others  shot them in competitions at sporting clubs. And then they were gone,  their ubiquity giving way only to nostalgia.

Forgiving student debt for low-income and middle class individuals who have attended public colleges and universities I‚Äôve also directed my team to develop a plan to forgive federal student debt relating to the cost of tuition currently held by low-income and middle-class people for undergraduate public colleges and universities, as well as private Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and private, underfunded Minority-Serving Institution (MSIs). The concept I‚Äôm announcing today will align my student debt relief proposal with my forward-looking college tuition proposal. Under this plan, I propose to forgive all undergraduate tuition-related federal student debt from two- and four-year public colleges and universities for debt-holders earning up to $125,000, with appropriate phase-outs to avoid a cliff. The federal government would pay the monthly payment in lieu of the borrower until the forgivable portion of the loan was paid off. This benefit would also apply to individuals holding federal student loans for tuition from private HBCUs and MSIs. This proposal would be in addition to my existing student debt proposals: - Immediately cancel a minimum of $10,000 of student debt per person, as proposed by Senator Warren in the midst of the coronavirus crisis. - Those earning less than $25,000 per year will not have to make monthly payments and will accrue no interest \n"

      "Eye size ranges from 5-120 miles across, but most are 20-40 miles in diameter. Understanding exactly how the eye forms has been controversial. Some scientists believe the radial spreading of the wind creates a warm dry down flow from the upper atmosphere, and this forms the cloud-free eye. Others have think the latent heat release in the eyewall forces the subsidence in the storm center creating the eye. The Eyewall is a ring of deep convection bordering the eye of the storm. This area has the highest surface winds in the tropical cyclone. Because air in the eye is slowly sinking, it creates an updraft in the eyewall. In particularly strong storms, concentric eyewall circles (or an ‚Äúeyewall replacement cycle‚Äù) can occur. Eyewall replacement happens when a storm reaches its intensity threshold and the eye contracts to a smaller size (5-15 miles). Strong rain bands in the outer storm move inward towards the eye, robbing the inner eyewall of its moisture and momentum and weakening the storm. Spiral Bands are long, narrow bands of rain and thunderstorms that are oriented in the same direction as the wind movement. They are caused by convection (the vertical movement of air masses) and they spiral into the center of the tropical cyclone. In contrast, the Moat of a storm usually refers to the region between the eyewall and an outer spiral band where rainfall is relatively lighter. References: Hawkins, H.F., and D.T.

      "Our research demonstrates that violations often stem from disadvantage. Many people cannot afford to pay their supervision fees or other court costs while supporting themselves and their families. As a result, people often do not make their required payments. While the US Supreme Court forbids courts from jailing people solely because they are poor, judges often fail to adequately assess whether someone can pay. Additionally, many people we interviewed said they stopped reporting to supervision because they did not have the money to pay their required fees for supervision or program requirements, eventually leading to violation proceedings for failure to report. Many people we interviewed also said that the lack of stable housing impeded their ability to comply with supervision conditions. Housing instability and homelessness often contribute to physical and mental health issues, making it harder for people to hold down jobs, attend supervision-mandated meetings, and regularly update their supervision officer on where they live. Further, people under correctional control are disproportionately likely to have mental health conditions, which can create added barriers to navigating supervision. Meanwhile, many communities lack accessible, voluntary mental health services and treatment options. High numbers of people are incarcerated for using drugs, including people who are struggling with substance use disorder. Many judges and supervision officers we spoke to argue that jailing people is necessary to stop them from harming themselves or others. But incarceration is, per se, a disproportionate response to personal drug use. It‚Äôs also ineffectual public health policy; health experts largely disagree that incarceration helps people recover from substance use disorder. \n"

LDPE has a melting point of 110ÀöC to 125ÀöC (230ÀöF to 257ÀöF), LLDPE is 115ÀöC to 128ÀöC (239ÀöF to 262ÀöF), HDPE is 130ÀöC to 135ÀöC (266ÀöF to 275ÀöF) and PP is 165ÀöC to 175ÀöC (329ÀöF to 347ÀöF). When LDPE is heated in the absence of a flame the material will soften and melt to give a clear liquid as the crystal structures are destroyed. The melt is stable, in the absence of air, up to approximately 300ÀöC/572ÀöF when it decom- poses to give low molecular weight hydrocarbons. Cross-linked PE will not melt but will become rubbery at approximately 115ÀöC/239ÀöF. LDPE can be cut or scratched easily with a knife. The shrinkage of LDPE is of the order of 0.02 to 0.05 in/in (2% to 5%) when the density is 0.910 to 0.925 g/cm3. It is in the range of 0.015 to O.04 in/in (1.5% to 4%) when the density is 0.926 to 0.94 As the natural color of the material is off-white, a wide color range is possible. This does not include transparent colors in thick sections. It is sold in both compounded colors and as natural material for coloring on the processing machine, by techniques such as dry coloring, masterbatching and liquid color- ing. When coloring LDPE, organic dyes should not be used, due to the prob- lem of color leeching or bleeding (often called blush). For most coloring pur- poses organic and inorganic pigments are preferred. When dry coloring LDPE, colorant levels of up to 1% are generally used. Wetting agents are used with dry colorants, primarily for cleanliness in the processing shop, rather than for aiding the dispersion of the colorant. Universal type master batches are often used with LDPE at concentration levels of 1%.

According to Gerson, Kushner dismissed the theory, and Bannon did not react before he was quickly pulled into another meeting. Gerson said that the Steele dossier \"wasn't specifically referred to\" during the meeting. Nader had two subsequent meeting in the White House which Gerson facilitated, including in mid-April 2017 related to Qatar and Saudi Arabia and early May 2017 related to the UAE.

      "- Export compensation adder: Residential PG&E and SCE customers who apply to interconnect NBT facilities to the grid before the end of 2027 receive slightly higher-than-normal bill credits for exported energy for nine years. (SDG&E customers are excluded because their solar systems generate more bill savings due to SDG&E‚Äôs higher electric rates). Customers who are required to add solar (e.g., by California‚Äôs building code for new construction) do not receive the adder. - ‚ÄúElectrification‚Äù TOU rate requirement: Customer-generators are required to take service on a specific TOU rate with lower off-peak prices and higher on-peak prices than other TOU rates. These rates reduce GHG emissions and strain on the electric grid by discouraging energy use at peak demand times of day, and they encourage customers to use electric vehicles and appliances by charging less for energy at other times. The rates currently approved are E-ELEC for PG&E, TOU-D-PRIME for SCE, and EV-TOU-5 for SDG&E. - Nine-year legacy period: The original customer who causes a generation facility to be interconnected to the grid under the NBT is guaranteed the use of the NBT tariff for nine years. Customer-generators who move to the NBT from a previous NEM tariff are not eligible for the NBT legacy period. - Monthly bill payment: Payment for bill charges is due monthly, so that customers are not surprised by a large annual bill after their true-up date. In months when there are excess solar bill credits, the credits roll over to following months, until the annual true-up. For more information on the NEM Revisit Rulemaking (R.20-08-020) and Net Billing tariff, please visit the NEM Revisit webpage. Virtual net energy metering (VNEM) enables an owner of a multi-tenant property to allocate a renewable electrical generation facility‚Äôs benefits to tenants across multiple units.

Doc. 65‚Äì616 (Washington, DC: Government Printing Office, November 15, 1917), 3-4. 276 Like Arthur Link, Joseph Kenkel, and Karen Schnietz, I heavily attribute Wilson‚Äôs shift in supporting the Tariff Commission to partisan motivations. But, in contrast with those scholars, I place great emphasis on the continuing influence of Wilson‚Äôs deep grounding in the ideas of international liberalism and his distrust of commission government. Accordingly, even more than Link and Schnietz, I would emphasize the tactical nature of his shift. 277 Also like Link, Kenkel, and Schnietz, I attach great importance to the historical contingency associated with the wartime crisis in 1915‚Äì16, but I emphasize far more than they do the political and fiscal impact of financing preparedness on the enactment of the Tariff Commission. For my analysis of the response of the Wilson administration to the fiscal crisis of 1914‚Äì16, see W. Elliot Brownlee, ‚ÄúWilson and Financing the Modern State‚Äù Democratic leadership would be fair and competent. Democratic partisan politics had driven  the process of creating the Tariff Commission, and after the 1916 election Democratic leaders  were optimistic that they would remain in control of the federal government. McAdoo himself  harbored the ambition to run for the Presidency in 1920.  The country‚Äôs entry into the First World War almost immediately after the opening of the Tariff  Commission‚Äôs doors changed the roles that the Wilson administration had intended for the  Commission and its members. Other chapters in this volume will discuss the changes that  occurred during the 1920s. But one thing that did not change was Wilson‚Äôs belief in the power  of free trade. If anything, the war strengthened this belief. In 1918, in crafting the third of his  Fourteen Points, Wilson advanced one of his most eloquent and concise statements for free  \n"

Generally visual  H.3.5.2 Visual sweep widths are determined by choosing an uncorrected sweep width based on type  of search object and SRU altitude and correcting it for environmental conditions, speed, and  fatigue. For maritime SAR, sweep width corrected (Wc) = sweep width uncorrected (Wu) x  weather correction (fw) x fatigue correction (ff) x speed correction (fv-aircraft only). For land  searches, see the IAMSAR Manual. Maritime sweep width tables are provided below. Factors  (a) Search Object characteristics.

The maximum range at which large unlighted objects such as  landmasses can be seen constitutes meteorological visibility. Reduced visibility results in  (c) Terrain/Sea Conditions. Normally, the more level the terrain, the more effective a land  search can be. Trees, rock outcroppings, and other surface irregularities decrease search  effectiveness.  Similarly, characteristics of the water surface such as sea state, whitecaps,  wind streaks, foam streaks, breaking seas, swell systems, salt spray, and sun reflections  decrease search effectiveness over water. Over water sweep width decreases as wind speed  (d) Cloud Cover. Visual sweep widths may be reduced 10 to 20 percent by cloud cover above  (e) Search Altitudes for Aircraft. For many objects, the available sweep width tables indicate  that sweep width increases slightly with increasing altitude up to 3,000 feet under ideal  conditions.  However, these figures should not be given undue regard as the smaller  increases indicated are generally within the estimation error of the methods used to create  the tables.  For example, at 500 and 1,000 feet, the uncorrected sweep width for a four- person raft is given as 1.8 NM while at 1,500 and 2,000 feet the uncorrected sweep width  is given as 1.9 NM.

      "The traditional definition of diversity is broad, encompassing not only race, ethnicity, and gender but also religious beliefs, national origin, and cognitive and physical abilities as well as sexual preference or orientation. This section examines two of these categories, religion and ability, looking at how an ethical manager handles them as part of an overall diversity policy. In both cases, the concept of reasonable accommodation means an employer must try to allow for differences among the workforce. In the United States, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), passed in 1990, stipulates that a person has a disability if he or she has a physical or mental impairment that reduces participation in ‚Äúa major life activity,‚Äù such as work. An employer may not discriminate in offering employment to an individual who is diagnosed as having such a disability. Furthermore, if employment is offered, the employer is obliged to make reasonable accommodations to enable him or her to carry out normal job tasks. Making reasonable accommodations may include altering the physical workplace so it is readily accessible, restructuring a job, providing or modifying equipment or devices, or offering part-time or modified work schedules. Other accommodations could include providing readers, interpreters, or other necessary forms of assistance such as an assistive animal (Figure 8.5). The ADA also prohibits discriminating against individuals with disabilities in providing access to government services, public accommodations, transportation, telecommunications, and other essential services.19 healthcare industries tend to hire more women and minorities in general? Why or why not? Chapter 8 Recognizing and Respecting the Rights of All A person with a service dog can usually perform all the essential function of the job, with some assistance.

Al treatment with or without magnetic  fields significantly increased levels of Al in the cortex, and increased AŒ≤ concentration  and neuronal losses in the cortex and hippocampus: magnetic fields alone did not affect  these outcomes. Al significantly reduced water intake and body weight gain during the  study period, possibly due to differences in palatability of the AlCl3 solution.  Deng et al. (2013) investigated whether memory impairments produced in mice by  chronic Al treatment could be modulated by magnetic field exposure. It was found that  water maze performance was impaired in Kunming mice that had been treated for 8  weeks with either 50 Hz fields at 2 mT for 4 h/day, 6 days/week, given daily Al loading  (200 mg/kg) or given both magnetic fields and Al. In addition, in all three experimental  groups there was neuronal cell loss and overexpression of phosphorylated tau protein in  the hippocampus and cerebral cortex, plus superoxide dismutase activity was decreased  and malondialdehyde was increased.

Additionally, we, the OIG, have taken steps to address this fraud, including contacting major retailers and gift card distributors to discuss point-of-sale consumer education about the phone scams and partnering with other Federal and State law enforcement agencies to leverage resources in conducting investigations related to this SSA recognizes it is accountable for ensuring its employees have the training and technology they need to take timely, quality actions. In addition, SSA recognizes its managers need to understand how to maximize employee performance so SSA can serve the public. SSA‚Äôs framework for comprehensive human capital management includes three major focus areas: workforce management, succession management, and performance management. Leadership development continues to be an imperative, both in terms of helping current leaders meet demands of the modern workplace and equipping next-in-line leaders to assume crucial responsibilities.

Once these cities lifted the restrictions, however, their trajectory soon turned into a double-humped curve with two peaks instead of one.

At the highest math levels, 27 percent of Whites took precalculus and calculus compared with only 15 percent of  Latinos. Swail et al. (2005) found that taking precalculus and calculus increased the chances of college completion of Latinos by 12 percent. These low participation rates may explain why college dropout rates of certain racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic groups remain relatively high.    Hoffman, Llagas, and Snyder (2003) reported a similar pattern for African American students, who  are more likely to attend public high schools with high minority concentrations from low socioeconomic communities.  They were less likely than White students to take advanced mathematics and science  courses, and were less likely than White or Hispanic students to take advanced placement exams.   According to O‚ÄôBrien and Zudak (1998), segregated neighborhoods usually equate to inferior resources, which eventually results in inferior levels of education for minority groups. Gonzalez et al. (1996) further supported this finding by examining the combined effect of family and neighborhood influences on the school performance of African American high school students. They found that family SES was less  predictive of academic achievement as compared to neighborhood SES factors. Neighborhood factors  related to lower grades and moderated parenting support, which may be the result of having financially weaker neighborhood schools that struggle to attract and keep qualified teachers (Wenglinsky 1998), an issue addressed again in the discussion of socioeconomic status.   Approximately one in three college students come from families where neither parent had any  postsecondary education (National Survey of Student Engagement (NSSE) 2005).

The models do not, however, fully  account for all constraints that could affect realization of pathways  Section 2.3 assesses the overall characteristics of 1.5¬∞C pathways  based on fully integrated pathways, while Sections 2.4 and 2.5 describe  underlying sectoral transformations, including insights from sector- specific assessment models and pathways that are not derived from  IAMs. Such models provide detail in their domain of application and  make exogenous assumptions about cross-sectoral or global factors.  They often focus on a specific sector, such as the energy (Bruckner et  al., 2014; IEA, 2017a; Jacobson, 2017; OECD/IEA and IRENA, 2017),  buildings (Lucon et al., 2014) or transport (Sims et al., 2014) sector, or  a specific country or region (Giannakidis et al., 2018). Sector-specific  pathways are assessed in relation to integrated pathways because they  cannot be directly linked to 1.5¬∞C by themselves if they do not extend  to 2100 or do not include all GHGs or aerosols from all sectors. AR5 found sectoral 2¬∞C decarbonization strategies from IAMs to be  consistent with sector-specific studies (Clarke et al., 2014). A growing  body of literature on 100%-renewable energy scenarios has emerged  (e.g., see Creutzig et al., 2017; Jacobson et al., 2017), which goes  beyond the wide range of IAM projections of renewable energy shares  in 1.5¬∞C and 2¬∞C pathways.

That makes a great deal of difference to us, because if we can co-fund a project, that gets more mileage out of our own few dollars. But you know, I think, as well as I do, that this is a very difficult time for private sector fund raising, as well, if only because of the volume of the number of institutions there of all kinds that are turning to private corporations and foundations for support, and in part because of their losing funds from public revenue sources. So the competition there is fierce as well as for our dollars. Whether we have adequately tapped the possibilities for private sector funding in this area, I do not know, but I do know that while I would certainly encourage efforts to do more private sector fund raising, I am also keenly aware that there are limits to what can be expected. That again is what brings me back to recommending to you the consideration of some kind of documentary strategy in this area as in others, because however much additional funds we are able to generate from whatever sources, they are not going to be enough to save all the collections that people would like to save. Mr. Stevens may wish to speak to private funding. I do not know. MR.

      "workers to self-isolate and hence controlling the spread of the disease. More generally, it plays a  crucial role in supporting workers during a sickness spell: in protecting their incomes, their jobs and their health. However, paid sick leave can only be an effective tool during the containment, mitigation and post- confinement periods if it is widely available to large parts of the labour force. This was by no means the case in all countries prior to the crisis. Many workers, especially those in diverse forms of employment, particularly informal economy workers and the self-employed, were unprotected or insufficiently protected by collectively financed sickness benefits. In addition to constituting important poverty risks, such gaps in protection threaten public health, since workers who lack income security during sickness may be  compelled to work when sick, thereby possibly contaminating others.  Consequently, many G20 countries substantially expanded or even initiated sick leave policies in response to the pandemic. In Korea, where there is no mandatory scheme in place, the 2015 Epidemic Act extended paid sick leave to workers who are hospitalised or quarantined because of COVID-19. The United States introduced two weeks of mandatory sick pay for workers with COVID-19-related symptoms for companies  with less than 500 employees ‚Äì the sick pay being paid by employers but fully reimbursed by the federal government.

      "Old Left, remained popular in the New Left and throughout progressive movements of the 1980s and 1990s. By singing union songs in later movements, Seeger helped carry a particular ideology about class ‚Äì a model of protest as originating in the mass revolt and daily lives of those at the bottom ‚Äì into later movements that were not mobilized around class issues. The Bread and Puppet Theater, which constructed large and colorful puppets and dramatized political issues and stances, had its origins in the 1960s protest cycle, but was even larger and more visible during the antiglobalization protests of the late 1990s and early 2000s. It was clearly a part of the tactical and cultural repertoire of earlier protests that survived to shape the actions of the later ones. Other cultural products are also important in cultural spillover, such as influential publications Mother Jones, the Progressive, or Ms. Magazine, that bridge multiple movements, synthesizing their messages in new ways and then disseminating those messages to activists. Activists‚Äô cultural styles indicate social movement spillover at the same time as they show how organizers innovate when they adopt cultural repertoires. For example, activist and writer L. A. Kaufmann (2001b) describes how antiglobaliza- tion protesters planned to wear gas masks at a protest against the World Bank in Washington.3 In doing so, they not only sought to protect themselves against tear gas (an instrumental purpose), but symbolically referred to the history of police brutality during protests against the Vietnam War, and to the police brutality directed against antiglobalization protesters in Seattle in 1999 and Quebec City in the spring of 2001. As they gathered gas masks, however, organizers decorated them, painting them with bright colors, adding glitter, in order to project the sense of play that characterized at least some factions of this movement, which reflected in part the influence of flamboyantly visible queer protest in the preceding decade (Kaufmann \n"

Allen and Amie Parnes reported that immediately after the election, Robby Mook and John Podesta decided to assert that Russian hacking was the real reason for the defeat.[318] Several high-level Republicans,[who?] including those who would have benefited from Russia's efforts, have asserted that Russian interference did not determine the election's outcome. President Trump has asserted that \"the Russians had no impact on our votes whatsoever\",[319] and Vice President Pence has claimed that \"it is the universal conclusion of our intelligence communities that none of those efforts had any impact on the outcome of the 2016 election. \"[320] Secretary of State Mike Pompeo added that \"the intelligence community's assessment is that the Russian meddling that took place did not affect the outcome of the election\".[321][85] In fact, the official intelligence assessment of January 2017 did not evaluate whether Russian activities had any impact on the election's outcome,[322] and CIA spokesman Dean Boyd said Pompeo's remark was erroneous.[323] House Speaker Paul Ryan claimed that it was \"clear\" that the Russian interference \"didn't have a material effect on our elections\".[126][85] On the other hand, a number of former intelligence and law enforcement officials, at least one political scientist and one former U.S. president argue that Russian interference was decisive. In support of this argument, they point to the sophistication of the Russian propaganda on social media, the hacking of Democratic Party emails and the timing of their public release, the small shift in voter support needed to achieve victory in the Electoral College, and the relatively high number of undecided voters (who may have been more readily influenced).[85][126][84] James Clapper, the former director of National Intelligence, told Jane Mayer, \"it stretches credulity to think the Russians didn't turn the election ... \n"

      "One night I was on guard duty on top of our hooch, and we were hit with about 40 rockets. I was asleep on a cot at the time, and when the first rocket exploded, I think that I literally ran in the air to get inside of the bunker as soon as possible. When I first arrived in my engineer unit, which helped build QL1, our convoy was attacked and two drivers were killed. A couple of days later, one of the mechanics from the motorpool was working on the rock crusher and he fell into the crusher. About that time, I thought that I might never make it for a year. I was a Vietnam Era veteran. I was not a combat veteran. I am Chuck's uncle on his mother‚Äôs side. I am representing my entire family by writing this tribute to him. At the time of his death, he had his parents, Verna and Delma, a brother Larry, a sister LaCarolina, a half-brother Terry Pfeiffer, grandparents Henry & Bertha, three aunts, seven uncles and 37 cousins. We honor his memory and the memory of all the fallen heroes. Chuck died just short of his 21st birthday. He stepped on a lane mine and at that moment, we lost him forever. God bless him and keep him. Respectfully, Melvin Schmitt and Family I met a lot of good soldiers during my tour of duty. I learned what unity, love and respect means. I was called up as a WWII retread for the Korean War as a Sergeant. After graduating from OCS, I became an Infantry Platoon Leader in Korea, after which I stayed in the service. In August 1965, I joined the advanced party of the 1st Infantry Brigade of the \"Big Red One\". We cleared the area in the vicinity of Phuc Vinh in War Zone D and started combat operations. As the Intelligence Officer and Operations Officer, I wrote orders, directives, and intelligence summaries for many combat operations in War Zone D, C, the Iron Triangle, and several large rubber plantations in the 3rd Corps area of operations.

MEASURING THE EFFECTS OF EDUCATION ON HEALTH AND CIVIC ENGAGEMENT: PROCEEDINGS OF THE COPENHAGEN SYMPOSIUM ‚Äì ¬© OECD 2006 Description of the 1999 IEA Civic Education Study  The discussion thus far has covered a lot of ground, highlighting a number of ways in  which the existing literature suggests formal education, particularly within secondary  schools, affects civic and social engagement. The following section subjects most of these  potential explanatory factors to empirical testing, to determine which educational factors  affect which dimensions of engagement among adolescents (Table 3.4.1).  Table 3.4.1. Educational factors affecting civic and social engagement  Much of the existing literature has unavoidably been limited to individual nations,  primarily the United States, if only because of the limited data available to study civic  education across nations. The 1971 IEA data are dated, and only include ten nations.  More recently, Hahn (1998) published a book comparing civic education across five  nations, but she did not have randomly-selected and thus representative samples of  adolescents in each country.

You will agree with me that Nepal has tremendous economic potential, such as in high value agriculture and agro-industries, hydropower, and tourism. Nepal's liberal taxation, trade, investment, and foreign exchange regimes provide vast opportunities for foreign investment while the large markets across the border offer huge export potentials for the agro and manufacturing products. The potentials for tourism are even higher with large and growing middle class across the border. seriously start materializing these untapped potentials with much more vigor and passion, which are now available with political stability and resolution of constitutional transition.  Let me also mention that Nepal aspires to graduate from the status of least developed country as soon as possible, and this is only possible with expedited economic growth. For this to happen, our annual investment must at least be doubled; we have to build essential infrastructure including transportation, communication, and electricity. Focus must be on addressing the crippling energy crises that hold key to unleash rapid growth of many industries, as well as on connectivity to reach all Nepalese villages within the country, and the vast markets of the neighboring countries.

      "Much of the nation's wealth had been concentrated in the hands of a tiny military, political, or commercial elite through corruption and nontransparent government contracting practices. Crude oil exports provided the preponderance of both national foreign exchange earnings and government revenues. During the year the economy was static, with growth still impeded by grossly inadequate infrastructure, endemic corruption, and general economic mismanagement. Many direct controls on the private sector have been removed, but a huge and inefficient public sector continues to dominate and inhibit the formal sector. Government revenue rose following the doubling of world oil prices, but much of the gain was offset by production-site shut-downs due to ongoing community unrest in the oil-producing areas, which decreased oil production. The chronic fuel shortages that afflicted the country for several years largely ended by mid-year, mostly because the Government spent more than $400 million (approximately 40 billion naira) to subsidize fuel imports. The Government reintroduced fertilizer subsidies and announced a phased, potentially lengthy privatization process. There continued to be serious problems in the Government's human rights record; however, there were marked improvements in several areas during the year. After 16 years of military rule, citizens had the opportunity to choose their government in elections. National police, army, and security forces committed numerous extrajudicial killings and used excessive force to quell civil unrest under both the Abubakar and Obasanjo governments, although they did so less frequently than under the Abacha regime. Disappearances remained a problem. Army, police, and security force officers regularly beat protesters, criminal suspects, detainees, and convicted prisoners; however, there were no reports of torture of political dissidents. \n"

      "Just as the organizers used genocide to wage war, so they used the war to cover the genocide. Whether speaking in foreign capitals or at sector meetings out on the Rwandan hills, representatives of the interim government always began with a reminder that the RPF had invaded Rwanda in 1990 and from that deduced that the RPF was responsible for all subsequent developments, including the massive killing of Tutsi by Hutu. Without hesitation, they blamed the assassination of Habyarimana on the RPF, making it an illustration of the larger theme of Tutsi aggression and ruthlessness. In early April, Sindikubwabo described the violence as a spontaneous outburst of rage sparked by \"sorrow and aggressive feelings of frustration\" after the assassination.94 Kambanda explained that Habyarimana was \"not an ordinary man, not a man like any other,\" and asserted that his killing created \"a certain frustration among people, a certain vague anger that made it impossible for people to keep control after the death of the head of state. \"95 The excuse of \"spontaneous anger\" echoed the attempts at justification during the Habyarimana period when authorities attributed killings of Tutsi to uncontrollable popular wrath. The pretext of popular anger was meant not just to confuse foreigners about the organized and systematic nature of the violence, but also to encourage Rwandans to feel justified in participating in it. According to witnesses, many assailants declared during attacks that Tutsi deserved to die because the Inyenzi hadkilled the president. After the militia leader, Cyasa Habimana, led the slaughter of some 1,000 persons at the Saint Joseph center in Kibungo, the bishop confronted him to ask why he had killed. The militia leader pointed to the portrait pin of Habyarimana that he wore on his chest and said, \"They killed him. \n"

      "67. The Church's social doctrine ‚Äúis itself a valid instrument of evangelization‚Äù [87] and is born of the always new meeting of the Gospel message and social life. Understood in this way, this social doctrine is a distinctive way for the Church to carry out her ministry of the Word and her prophetic role[88]. ‚ÄúIn effect, to teach and to spread her social doctrine pertains to the Church's evangelizing mission and is an essential part of the Christian message, since this doctrine points out the direct consequences of that message in the life of society and situates daily work and struggles for justice in the context of bearing witness to Christ the Saviour‚Äù[89]. This is not a marginal interest or activity, or one that is tacked on to the Church's mission, rather it is at the very heart of the Church's ministry of service: with her social doctrine the Church ‚Äúproclaims God and his mystery of salvation in Christ to every human being, and for that very reason reveals man to himself‚Äù[90]. This is a ministry that stems not only from proclamation but also from witness. 68. The Church does not assume responsibility for every aspect of life in society, but speaks with the competence that is hers, which is that of proclaiming Christ the Redeemer[91]: ‚ÄúChrist did not bequeath to the Church a mission in the political, economic or social order; the purpose he assigned to her was a religious one. But this religious mission can be the source of commitment, direction and vigour to establish and consolidate the community of men according to the law of God‚Äù[92]. This means that the Church does not intervene in technical questions with her social doctrine, nor does she propose or establish systems or models of social organization[93]. This is not part of the mission entrusted to her by Christ. The Church's competence comes from the Gospel: from the message that sets man free, the message proclaimed and borne witness to by the Son of God made man. \n"

The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) approved Nigeria‚Äôs request for emergency financial assistance of SDR 2,454.5 million (US$ 3.4 billion, 100 percent of quota) under the Rapid Financing Instrument (RFI) to meet the urgent balance of payment needs stemming from the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Even before the COVID-19 outbreak, Nigeria‚Äôs economy was facing headwinds from rising external vulnerabilities and falling per capita GDP levels. The pandemic‚Äîalong with the sharp fall in oil prices‚Äîhas magnified the vulnerabilities, leading to a historic decline in growth and large financing needs. The IMF financial support will help limit the decline in international reserves and provide financing to the budget for targeted and temporary spending increases aimed at containing and mitigating the economic impact of the pandemic and of the sharp fall in international oil prices. The IMF remains closely engaged with the Nigerian authorities and stands ready to provide policy advice and further support, as needed.

Her family accepts her sexuality, which Owunna says challenges the assumption that all African families are homophobic or would reject their children for being LGBTQ. For many of the people Owunna interviewed, the solution has largely been to create spaces of community with other black queer folks who understand and uplift one another. Many told him they simply hadn't met or been exposed to other people who fit both identities when they were growing up. History was also a big factor in a lot of the subjects' healing. Several people allude to their own research on indigenous African sexualities and the British empire's role in enforcing heteronormativity in African society. The historical theme and idea that queerness is not new to the continent is present in Owunna's creative decisions, too. There are symbols from the ancient Nigerian writing system, Nsibidi, throughout the book, such as one translated to two women sleeping and embracing one another. Owunna also organized the photographs into four chapters in accordance with the four Igbo calendar days, depending on which day they were taken. Olave is a self-described nonbinary trans femme from Burundi. Growing up in the Netherlands, she says she felt cast out by Dutch society until she stopped trying to fit in. \n"

      "overall aim of the summit was to bring together ministers of education and industry leaders  to start a dialogue on policies and strategies to foster innovation in education. As in all sectors, innovation will be essential to bring about qualitative changes in education,  as opposed to the quantitative expansion seen so far. These changes are needed to increase  efficiency and improve the quality and equity of learning opportunities. Although education is  not a change-averse sector, with improvements already taking place in classrooms, it has not  managed to harness technology to raise productivity, improve efficiency, increase quality and  foster equity in the way other public sectors have. At the same time education can also foster  innovation in society at large by developing the right skills to nurture it. These skills, including critical thinking, creativity and imagination, can be fostered through appropriate teaching, and  practices such as entrepreneurship education. Governments should develop smart innovation  strategies for education with the right policy mix to give meaning and purpose to innovation,  including creating an innovation-friendly culture. The steep increase in the use of digital devices and the Internet with increasing levels of  education shows that education matters in the uptake of digital technologies.

A selection of these laws include the 1941 National TV Ownership Rule, which states that a broadcaster cannot own television stations that reach more than 35 percent of the nation‚Äôs homes; the 1970 Radio/ TV Cross-Ownership Restriction, which prohibits a broadcaster from owning a radio station and a TV station in the same market; and the 1975 Newspaper/Broadcast Cross-Ownership Prohibition, which discourages ownership of a newspaper and a TV station in the same market (PBS, 2004). Today, the FCC continues to hold the primary responsibility for regulating media outlets, with the FTC taking on a smaller role. Although each commission holds different roles and duties, the overall purpose of governmental control remains to establish and bring order to the media industry while ensuring the promulgation of the public good. This section examines the modern duties of both commissions. The FCC contains three major divisions: broadcast, telegraph, and telephone. Within these branches, subdivisions allow the agency to more efficiently carry out its tasks. Presently, the FCC houses 7 operating bureaus and 10 staff offices.

We support the sale of a part of the Fund's gold to support concessional lending to low income countries thorough the Fund's concessional windows. The multilateral development banks can play an important role in maintaining the flow of resources to developing countries over the next two years. As an immediate step, we must endorse a 200% increase in the capital of the Asian Development Bank which can be approved by its Board of Governors The World Bank should also expand its lending in the next two to three years in a manner which helps to fill the gap left by the withdrawal of private capital flows. By directing its lending to infrastructure development and recapitalisation of the banks, it would help to support contra-cyclical policy in a manner which stimulates an early resumption of growth in these economies. To perform this role, the Bank's present single borrower limits need to be urgently reviewed. Its debt to capital ratio also needs to be made more liberal. We must also take concrete steps to revive trade finance which has been badly hit in part, I regret to say, because of financial protectionism. Export credit agencies can expand their lending. The IFC pool to support trade finance can be substantially expanded, with bilateral assistance from An issue of vital concern to developing countries is the rise of protectionist sentiment in the industrialised world. This phenomenon is not surprising, given the downturn in economic activity and the rise in unemployment. However, it will be a test of leadership whether we can persuade the public that we must not repeat past mistakes. We know that the Great Depression \n"

      "Recommendations (CEACR), however, several countries have amended their legis- lation, including at the constitutional level, to ensure that all workers have the right of  freedom of association, including Chile, El Salvador and Kenya.25 Ensuring full access to freedom of association and collective bargaining for non- standard workers is essential for safeguarding their right to equality of treatment  before the law and vis-√†-vis their employers. Section 6.2 provides examples in   which better treatment, stability and equal working conditions have been ne goti -  a ted for these workers through collective bargaining.26 To ensure effective protection  of collective rights for non-standard workers, some existing regulations may need to  be adapted, in particular regarding solidarity action and collective bargaining, when  more than one firm or employer is involved in determining terms and conditions of  employment, such as in the case of TAW or other contractual arrangements involving  In this regard, it is important to consider the Conclusions of the Tripartite Meeting   of Experts on Non-Standard Forms of Employment which specifically addressed   this issue by stating that ‚ÄúGovernments, employers and workers should use social dia- logue to develop innovative approaches, including regulatory initiatives that enable  workers in non-standard forms of employment to exercise these rights and enjoy the  protection afforded to them under the applicable collective agreements.

      "Samples were collected by scraping using a 30G ¬Ω needle. The Raman scattering experiments were performed using a Raman Witec Alpha 300 confocal microscope with an excitation laser operating at 532nm and focused by a 50x lens.  Analyses of the various samples were performed, visually searching for similarities between the pigments of the four frames. pigments was identified as: blue, white, orange, brown, and green in both frames; there were cases of a frame having more colors than those mentioned, which were not discarded, because there is future intention of creating a database of national pigments. In some cases, the Raman spectrum was clearly visible, but in most of the spectra, the luminescence was present, so by analyzing the line shape and the light emission peaks, this study could find other components present in the paintings, as in the case of yellow, orange, red, and green contributions In cases in which the spectrum was clearly visible, it was possible to identify the similarity to the violet diaxazine pigment, which was present in several of the samples. The oranges and browns in two of the works show a great chance of compatibility, in addition to the white present in three paintings, which presented a luminescence characteristic already expected to be this pigment.  From the analysis performed, it is possible to state that there are great similarities between the pictures. measurements related to the standard frame, certified by S√©rgio Telles himself, compare these with the results already obtained by the questioned frames, and use the Raman technique with infrared excitation laser to decrease the effect of luminescence.

The Appeals Chamber observes that, in summarising the relevant evidence related to Scheduled Incidents G.1 and G.2, the Trial Chamber recalled threats issued by Mladic in May 1992, suggesting that Sarajevo would be subject to an attack of an indiscriminate nature should ABiH forces attack SRK positions in Sarajevo.F'!' In this respect, the Trial Chamber credited evidence The Trial Chamber further recalled evidence of the orders Mladic issued in relation to the attacks alleged in Scheduled Incidents G.1 and G.2, which, in the Appeals Chamber's view, include clear intent to fire shells without regard for the principles of distinction and protection of civilian objects and the civilian popularion.l'!\" For example, in relation to Scheduled Incident G.1, Mladic ordered an SRK artillery officer, to fire at the railway station and to \"scatter them around\". 1315 In relation to Scheduled Incident G.1, the Trial Chamber noted evidence from General John Wilson, the then Chief Military Observer of the UN Protection Force (\"UNPROFOR\"), that the shelling on 28 May 1992 was widespread, and scattered around the city, but at the same time was 1309 Cf Galic Trial Judgement, para. 51.

In incidents where it is  suspected that CBRN materials have been used as weapons, NIOSH-certified respirators with  CBRN protection are highly recommended. Be aware that the presence and identification of  CB agents or radioactive materials may not be verifiable, especially in the case of biological  or radiological agents. The following actions/measures to be considered are applicable to  either a chemical, biological or radiological incident.  The guidance is general in nature, not  all encompassing, and its applicability should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Approach and response strategies. Protect yourself and use a safe approach (minimize  any exposure time, maximize the distance between you and the item that is likely to harm you,  use cover as protection and wear appropriate personal protective equipment and respiratory  protection).  Identify and estimate the hazard by using indicators as provided above.

To the extent possible, take measures to limit the  spread of contamination.

Some chemicals deaden the  senses giving the false perception that the chemical is no longer present.

(2012) reported that exposure of mice to 50 Hz magnetic field at 1 mT for 4  h/day for 12 weeks did not cause any changes in behaviour in an open field, but resulted  in significant impairments in learning in both the spatial version of the water maze task  and in a cued version. Training occurred over four days, as is standard, but a probe trial  (without the escape platform being present) was not performed to measure spatial  memory.  In addition, exposure was reported to affect markers of oxidative stress in the  hippocampus and striatum (the activities of catalase and glutathione peroxidise (GPx)  were decreased, and the concentration of malondialdehyde (MDA) was increased).  Exposure at 0.1 mT was without any significant effect.   Li et al. (2014) investigated the effects on long-term exposure to a magnetic field on  spatial memory in Sprague-Dawley rats. Continuous exposure to a 50 Hz magnetic field  at 100 ¬µT for 90 days had no effect on the acquisition of the task in terms of either  escape latencies or swimming distances, nor did this exposure have any effect on task  performance during a second training session. During the probe trial conducted at the  end of each training session, exposure had no significant effects on behaviour, with all  groups showing comparable memory. This suggests that long-term exposure had no  significant effects on either acquisition or retention of the task.  Wang et al.

The assessment of kindergarten students must be administered at a minimum of once during the first forty-five days of the school year with the results collected by the department. The results of the assessments and the developmental intervention strategies recommended or services needed to address each child's identified needs must also be provided, in writing, to the parent or guardian. The assessment may not be used to deny a student admission to kindergarten. Accommodations that do not invalidate the results of these assessments must be provided in the manner set forth by the student's Individualized Education Program, 504 Accommodations Plan, or LEP Plan. Districts are given the option of designating up to two days of the one hundred eighty day school calendar to administer the assessment to kindergarten students. The department will also provide the results of the assessment of kindergarten students to the Education Oversight Committee. With available funds, the department will also provide or secure training for appropriate educators in how to administer the assessment. For all students assessed with the Kindergarten Readiness Assessment (KRA), the Department of Education is required to collect data from schools and school districts on the prior early learning experience of each student. The data would include whether the kindergartener had attended in the prior school year a Head Start program, a South Carolina Early Reading Development and Education Program in a public school or a private center, a half-day 4K program in a public school, a full-day 4K program in a public school, a child care center (registered faith-based, registered family home, group home, or exempt provider) or informal child care. \n"

      "The obvious answer to the puzzle is Xi Jinping and the regime that he both represents and has helped to create. But key elements of China‚Äôs earlier strat- egy ‚Äì including the BRI and reserve-currency status for the renminbi ‚Äì were Xi‚Äôs own signature gambits. So, what‚Äôs driving the reversal? Perhaps China's leaders once again see the world through a victim‚Äôs lens. As they perceive it, the powerful West had kept a weak China in check since the early 1800s. Now that the roles are reversed, the regime believes it is time to correct historical injustices. With Xi‚Äôs aggressive insecurity having replaced Deng‚Äôs calm confidence, China now places a premium on settling its borders and returning to the glory days of  the Middle Kingdom. A darker possibility for the rest of  the world is that China not only seeks historical justice, but is also gazing beyond its borders. It is in the nature of repressive, autocratic regimes to believe only in the currency of fear and hard power. In this view, Xi is merely reverting to type, following his idol Mao Zedong‚Äôs dictum that political power ‚Äì both internally and externally ‚Äì grows from the barrel of  a gun. So, perhaps China‚Äôs recent aggression is not a bug but rather a feature of  its strategy for supplanting the US. In her book The Guns of  August, American historian Barbara Tuchman memorably captured the shift in geopolitical power from the UK to the US by saying that a strong America became an enfeebled UK‚Äôs ‚Äúlarder, arsenal, and bank.‚Äù In the wake of  the pandemic, China could have achieved some- thing similar vis-√†-vis the US-led global order by becoming the develop- ment bank, central bank, and medical supplier to the world. By choosing un- provoked aggression over enlightened generosity, China has squandered the historic opportunity and possibly also revealed its true character. Soft power, China appears to believe, is for wimpy democracies. Scorpions sting. The The author is a former Chief Economic Adviser to the \n"

      "Is treasure hoard found in Germany linked to Nibelung legend? An amateur treasure hunter equipped with a metal detector has discovered a hoard of gold and silver dating back to late Roman times in a German forest. The finding has prompted speculation that it could be the legendary Nibelung treasure. The unnamed treasure seeker came across the buried treasure, estimated to be worth more than ‚Ç¨1 million, while searching a wooded area in southern Rhineland-Palatinate with a metal detector. The trove includes numerous leaf-shaped solid gold brooches, which are thought to have formed part of the decorations from a coat of a Roman ruler, as well as a solid silver bowl set with gold and stones set within it, and a set of gold and silver plated statuettes which formed part of a military commander‚Äôs portable chair. Experts say the treasure, some of which appears Eastern European in style, was buried around 1,500 years ago, about the time when Germanic Teutons were plundering and pillaging their way through the crumbling Roman Empire. ‚ÄúIn terms of timing and geography, the find fits in with the epoch of the Nibelung legend,‚Äù said Axel von Berg, the state‚Äôs chief archaeologist. ‚ÄúBut we cannot say whether it actually belongs to the Nibelung treasure,‚Äù he said, adding that whoever owned it had ‚Äúlived well‚Äù and could have been a prince. The Nibelungs is the most famous Epic in Norse mythology and is said to be based on the Royal family of Burgundy. The story begins when a treasure of the Burgundians falls into the hands of Siegfried. After helping King Gunther woo Brunhild, Siegfried marries Kriemhild, Gunther's sister. Ultimately, a row between the Queens leads to the death of both Siegfried and Kriemhild, and the loss of the treasure. Whether the treasure is the famous ‚ÄúRhinegold‚Äù or not, it seems to have been buried in haste by its owner or by robbers in around 406-407 AD, when the Roman Empire was falling apart in the area along the Rhine. \n"

Further, the dominance of an enterprise is always assessed with respect to a  ‚Äúrelevant market‚Äù.  According to Section 2(r) of the Competition Act, 2002,  ‚Äúrelevant market means the market which may be determined by the commission  with reference to the relevant product market or the relevant geographic market  or with reference to both the markets‚Äù. Thus, defining the relevant product and  geographic market accurately is a crucial exercise in the determination of  dominance. Section 19 (6) and Section 19 (7) of the Act lay down the  parameters of defining the relevant geographic and product markets  respectively.11 Like other competition laws across the world, the Competition  Act, 2002, focuses on ‚Äúsubstitutability‚Äù as a test for defining the relevant  market. An important tool for determining substitutability is the ‚ÄúSmall but  Significant, Non-Transitory Increase in Price‚Äù test or the SSNIP test. Simply  put, SSNIP evaluates whether, in the event of a small, yet significant price rise  (of about 5% to 10%), the consumers of a particular product would shift their                                                              9 The Competition Act, 12 of 2003, INDIA CODE (2002) ,Expl. to s. 4.  11 Id. s. 19(6) provides that ‚ÄúThe Commission shall, while determining the relevant  geographic market, have due regard to all or any of the following factors, namely:‚Äî (a)  \n"

Culture includes languagethe way in which way people are ruled, and religion, the way people The use of land by humans and the form of government in an area are often determined by the geography found there. The reason for such developments is that geography greatly affects the way people live and work. In other words, geography influences culture. History has shown that human culture has been directly influenced by the geography of each region. For example, the nearness of bodies of water, such as lakes, rivers, oceans, and the features of land determined methods of transportation. These physical characteristics also influenced the types of crops grown and the farming methods used. If the land was fertile, Natural resources, like the minerals copper, iron ore, gold, and silver, influenced many inventions. For example, metals such as copper were used for tools and money.

The Reid-based Behavioral Analysis Interview, which primarily consists of asking 15 to 20 questions designed to evoke particular behavioral (verbal, nonverbal, and paralinguistic) responses from which the interrogator can allegedly discern whether a suspect is telling the truth or lying, has its origins in the polygraph and like the polygraph has been empirically shown to have high rates of error.7 As Kassin and Gudjonsson note,12 police detectives and other professional lie-catchers are accurate only 45 to 60 percent of the time. Innocent persons may be mistakenly targeted for suspicion and misclassified as guilty suspects for other reasons. The suspect may, for example, simply be the most readily noticed person who fits a very general description given by an eyewitness or others. Although many may fit the description, the target may be chosen simply because he happens to be noticed by the police, reported by someone who had seen a police sketch or falsely identified from a mug shot or lineup, or he fits an official profile of the perpetrator. \n"

      "feedback to the basal cells regarding the number of  2.3.3.4 Genetics of Cell Cycle Regulation. Stimulatory  signals and inhibitory signals act on oncogenes and tumor  suppressor genes, respectively. Oncogenes are the genes  that, when translated, generate the proteins necessary  for a cell to undergo mitosis. Tumor suppressor genes are  genes whose protein products inhibit mitosis. An example  of the cell cycle genetic regulation in the epidermis would  be as follows: (1) the basal cells bind a stimulatory hormone  on a cell surface receptor; (2) a cascade of reactions takes  place inside the cell that results in the genes for cyclins  being translated; (3) the production of cyclins activates the  kinases, pushing the cells through mitosis; (4) the concentra- tion of chalones rises as the newly generated cells differenti- ate; (5) chalones diffuse to the basal cells and bind to the  appropriate cell surface receptor; (6) a cascade of reactions  inside the cells results in the translation of a tumor suppres- sant gene; and (7) the resultant suppressor protein binds to  and inactivates the kinases, thereby halting the cell cycle.  The friction ridge skin persists because of the physical  attachments throughout the skin and the regulation of  keratinocyte production and differentiation. The three- dimensional morphology of the surface ridge is maintained  by the combination of increased cell production in the  suprabasal layer of the primary ridges (under-the-surface  ridges) and the enhanced anchorage of the basal cells in  the secondary ridges (under-the-surface furrows). The basal  layer of keratinocytes provides the template for the surface  ridges and furrows. Cell communication ensures that basal  cell proliferation is stimulated and inhibited in a coordinated  manner. As the basal keratinocytes divide, the cell-to-cell  attachments ensure that the cells move toward the surface  Aging is defined by Dr. Barbara Gilchrest as ‚Äúan irrevers- ible process which begins or accelerates at maturity and  \n"

      "When we talk about symmetrical cores, we‚Äôre referring to the kind of large cores found in two-piece bowling balls that DO NOT have three distinct principal mass moments of inertia. In bowling terminology, this translates to those cores which do not have a significantly high intermediate differential. The convention among most ball drillers and manufacturers is to treat balls that have small intermediate differentials (for example, less than 0.008‚Äù) as symmetrical. Broadly speaking, there are two types of symmetrical cores: those that have axisymmetric geometry and those that have non-axisymmetric geometry. A bowling ball core with an axisymmetric geometry is one that can be created by revolving a two-dimensional profile about a central axis. One popular example of an axisymmetric core shape is the famous light bulb core that has been popular now for many years. The other type of symmetrical core, the non-axisymmetric symmetrical, has geometry that is more complicated than the axisymmetric symmetrical, but is still mathematically symmetrical due to the values of its principal mass moments of inertia. An example of a core that falls into this class is the Resurgence Symmetric core that is found in the Columbia 300 Eruption line of bowling balls. Its shape is mostly axisymmetric, but it does have a few small non-axisymmetric features. Another hypothetical example is shown in the image below. So, should anyone really care about the difference between an axisymmetric symmetrical core and a non-axisymmetric symmetrical core? In most cases, not really. While it is true that the gripping holes and balance hole can either hit or miss a core‚Äôs non-axisymmetric features depending on how it is drilled, the impact of this on the drilled ball‚Äôs mass properties is usually quite small. The main reason for mentioning the axisymmetric vs. non-axisymmetric distinction is simply is to point out that you can‚Äôt necessarily tell if a core is a symmetrical just by glancing at its shape. \n"

      "To this end, Congress levies taxes and tariffs to provide funding for essential government services. If enough money cannot be raised to fund the government, then Congress may also authorize borrowing to make up the difference. Congress can also mandate spending on specific items: legislatively directed spending, commonly known as ‚Äúearmarks,‚Äù specifies funds for a particular project, rather than for a government agency. Both chambers of Congress have extensive investigative powers, and may compel the production of evidence or testimony toward whatever end they deem necessary. Members of Congress spend much of their time holding hearings and investigations in committee. Refusal to cooperate with a congressional subpoena can result in charges of contempt of Congress, which could result in a prison term. The Senate maintains several powers to itself: It consents to the ratification of treaties by a two-thirds supermajority vote and confirms the appointments of the President by a majority vote. The consent of the House of Representatives is also necessary for the ratification of trade agreements and the confirmation of the Vice President. Congress also holds the sole power to declare war. Oversight of the executive branch is an important Congressional check on the President‚Äôs power and a balance against his or her discretion in implementing laws and making regulations. One primary way that Congress conducts oversight is through hearings. The House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform and the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Government Affairs are both devoted to overseeing and reforming government operations, and each committee conducts oversight in its policy area. Congress also maintains an investigative organization, the Government Accountability Office (GAO).

For example, major risk factors for gastric cancer in Japan (high salt intake and Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection) are significantly more prevalent than in the United States. Therefore, it is not appropriate to extrapolate from data on a Japanese population concerning the relationship between a substance and gastric cancer to reach conclusions about potential effects on the U.S. population. What type of information was collected? Biological samples (e.g., blood, urine, tissue, or hair) should be used to establish intake of a substance only if a dose-response relationship has been demonstrated between intake of the substance and the level of the substance (or a metabolite of the substance) in the biological sample. There should be evidence to demonstrate a strong correlation(23) between the intake level of the substance and the level of the substance or a metabolite in the biological sample (e.g., selenium intake and serum selenium concentration). If the correlation is weak for a specific biological sample, then scientific conclusions cannot be drawn from studies that used that biological sample as a biomarker of intake. Biological samples in case-control studies should not be used to establish intake of the substance since the metabolism or concentration of the substance may be altered in subjects as a result of the disease. Were scientifically acceptable and validated dietary assessment methods used to estimate intake of the substance? A single 24-hour diet recall or diet record is generally regarded as an inadequate method for assessing an individual's usual intake of a substance, although it may be useful for assessing mean intake of a group. \n"

Retrieved from https://www.ncsbn.org/public-files/PolicyBriefDisseminationofCOVID19Info.pdf Communication is the expression of a message between a sender and a recipient. Sounds simple but, it‚Äôs much more complicated than we realize. We communicate in different ways. Some prefer verbal communication, some prefer the written word in email or text, and others prefer to post on social media. There are so many ways to express ideas, yet so many opportunities for our messages to be misunderstood. Healthy work environments foster healthy communication; healthy communication allows involved parties to feel valued and respected and leads to flourishing relationships. In relationships where communication is poor or one-sided, trust and respect erode. Try taking these steps towards effective communication to build relationships and connection in your work environment. 1. Think first. Before you speak, text, email, or post, ask yourself: ‚ÄúWhere is this message coming from?‚Äù Are you communicating from a place of anger, frustration, fear, desperation, or exhaustion? Communicating from a place of emotion is more likely to lead to misinterpretation. Consider the root of an issue and take time to think about the most effective way to communicate without being perceived as combative, accusatory, apathetic, or insensitive. 2. Body language and tone matter. Most of us have been on the receiving end of a finger being thrust in our face, a text or email in all capital letters, or an angry stare. \n"

      "as memory. It is a ‚Äúcognitive memory,‚Äù a memory we can remember in our thinking brain, or  For explicit memory, we need the hippocampus. This part of the brain is responsible for  integrating the raw sensory data into a coherent picture, putting a time tag on it, and transferring it into long-term episodic memory, where it can be retrieved later. Over time, when memory is  consolidated, its long-term storage is distributed in different parts of the neocortex.    The amygdala, part of the limbic system, catalogues past sensory experiences (threats, anger) as  implicit memories, memories that are unconscious but can affect thoughts and behaviours.   These memories are associated with intense arousal making them readily primed in order to  quickly associate them with future situations that are stressful or threatening. This is a critical  survival feature of implicit memory, enabling an instant response to danger.   Memory consolidation signifies the stabilization process of a newly formed long-term memory.  McGaugh (2002) explains, that initially, unconsolidated memory is in a fragile state and can be  disrupted by several types of interference, including behavioral, pharmacological, and electrical.  Over time, the memory becomes resilient to these forms of interference through the process  Scientific information on the stabilization of memory through consolidation has significant  implications for the timing of police interviews. A victim interviewed shortly after an assault, or  while still very stressed or traumatized, will not be able to retrieve everything that‚Äôs been  encoded into her brain. Two full sleep cycles may be necessary for the episodic memory circuitry  to consolidate information that was encoded at the time of a trauma such as sexual assault.  Researchers have found that processes occurring during both rapid eye movement (REM) and  non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep also play critical roles in the consolidation of memories.   \n"

      "50. Instead of resolving the problems of the poor and thinking of how the world can be different, some can only propose a reduction in the birth rate. At times, developing countries face forms of international pressure which make economic assistance contingent on certain policies of ‚Äúreproductive health‚Äù. Yet ‚Äúwhile it is true that an unequal distribution of the population and of available resources creates obstacles to development and a sustainable use of the environment, it must nonetheless be recognized that demographic growth is fully compatible with an integral and shared development‚Äù.[28] To blame population growth instead of extreme and selective consumerism on the part of some, is one way of refusing to face the issues. It is an attempt to legitimize the present model of distribution, where a minority believes that it has the right to consume in a way which can never be universalized, since the planet could not even contain the waste products of such consumption. Besides, we know that approximately a third of all food produced is discarded, and ‚Äúwhenever food is thrown out it is as if it were stolen from the table of the poor‚Äù.[29] Still, attention needs to be paid to imbalances in population density, on both national and global levels, since a rise in consumption would lead to complex regional situations, as a result of the interplay between problems linked to environmental pollution, transport, waste treatment, loss of resources and quality of life. 51. Inequity affects not only individuals but entire countries; it compels us to consider an ethics of international relations. A true ‚Äúecological debt‚Äù exists, particularly between the global north and south, connected to commercial imbalances with effects on the environment, and the disproportionate use of natural resources by certain countries over long periods of time. \n"

This  represents the entirety of my interaction with the Sanders campaign, including my repeated, ignored  requests to remove myself from whatever master list they found me on. I will also be sending a copy  of this email and the attachments to the Sanders campaign at the only email address they've ever  given me - info@berniesanders.com. This may represent a shared inbox, or a dead-end sender  address - again, I've received no NON-spam contact from them besides an initial offer to remove  myself from only the top level list, nothing about contacting a source. In the meanwhile receiving  continued unwanted commercial solicitations on my phone in violation of CAN-SPAM.  I am more than willing, in fact, happy to drop this complaint should the Sanders campaign either  inform me of the source of receiving my address, or promise a good-faith effort to trace and remove  me from whatever source my contact info may have come from. No other conditions and I bear no  animosity towards the campaign - but never wanted to receive their communications.  I await your (and their) response. Thank you for your time.  \n"

      "Nearly all of the drivers in that race had been involved in the moonshine business in one way or another. Junior Johnson, one of the first drivers ever inducted into the NASCAR Hall of Fame, eloquently credits his superior driving skills with his experience hauling liquor: ‚ÄúWhen I sat down in that seat the first race I ever ran, it was a backseat to what I‚Äôd already been through. I had did all them spinning deals sideways and stuff like that. It just made my job so much easier than anybody I had seen come along and go into it.‚Äù In 1948, the National Association for Stock Car Racing was incorporated, and finally got our acronym. Big Bill was named its prez, and the rest, as they say, is history. In 1950, the first true NASCAR track opened in Darlington, South Carolina (hard to say ‚ÄúDarlington‚Äù without a southern accent, isn‚Äôt it?). And in 1979, we saw the first live television coverage of an entire NASCAR event, the Daytona 500, where an end-of-race brawl broke out on TV, boosting publicity and popularity across the nation. So even though we can now drink legally again in this great country, the speed-based sport born of bootlegging is more popular than ever. (Heck, even bootlegging didn‚Äôt stop when liquor became legal again.) NASCAR‚Äôs fame has spread from the southeastern U.S. to the rest of America and even internationally. \n"

      "This argument appears to be most viable when other dimensions of inequality are taken into account, especially political inequality, educational inequality, and the leveling of life-styles. The chapters by M√ºnch and Haferkamp in this volume appear to stress these other dimensions. M√ºnch develops a general model to explain changing levels of equality and inequality. His model is based on Parsons's perspective, in which many different processes of change proceed simultaneously, some working toward equality and some toward inequality. On balance, M√ºnch finds the forces pressing for equality in the United States to be stronger. At the same time, he points out the double tendency in this country, by which both equality and inequality are legitimized: \"The conflict between these two positions has been a major factor in hindering the establishment of a societal community properly embracing society as a whole, as opposed to a society breaking apart into different societal groups.\" Haferkamp stresses leveling tendencies as well. He argues that the masses have increased resources at their disposal and that this improves their potential for achievement. He also identifies a strengthening of the value of equality as an important factor in the leveling process. But above all he stresses the process of negotiation among significant economic and political groups (business, labor, agriculture, and the professions), a process that typically results in leveling compromises, and the continuing access to the centers of political on the part of these groups. Many of the apparent confusions and contradictions among these diagnoses of inequality probably stem from the problem of confounding apples and oranges. Different answers will emerge depending on which aspect of inequality‚Äîthe labor process, the distribution of property and income, social mobility and status attainment, or access to education, power, and prestige‚Äîis chosen for focus. \n"

Congress may be able to require that states waive their Eleventh Amend¬≠ ment immunity with respect to programs for which they voluntarily accept federal financial as¬≠ sistance.

Judge Funderburk reported he has not personally handled any criminal appeals. Judge Funderburk reported that he has held the following judicial office: I was sworn in on August 12, 2014, and signed a contract to begin my term of service on August 13, 2014. I was appointed by the Camden City Council. The jurisdiction of this court includes misdemeanors, traffic offenses, and violations of city ordinances occurring within the city limits of Camden, SC. It also includes bond hearings for these and other criminal charges arising within the city. Judge Funderburk provided the following regarding his most significant orders and opinions: Since I am still in training, I have not issued any orders or tried any cases. Accordingly, there has been no appellate review of anything I have done. Judge Funderburk further reported the following regarding an unsuccessful candidacy: The Commission believes that Judge Funderburk's temperament would be excellent. The Midlands Citizens Committee found Judge Funderburk to be \"Qualified\" in the evaluative criteria of character.

Initially, there was an urgent need to scale up the intensive care treatment capacity because the existing capacity was not enough to absorb the expected patient  caseload.

This is achieved by familiarization with the behavioral content relevant for each dimension; discussion of what constitutes different levels of performance; and practice and review, preferably with actual performance examples filmed or simulated. Through consultation with EAP counselors, specific job behaviors that may be more susceptible to the effects of stress or substance abuse may be identified and integrated into the content of the training program. A good supplement to frame-of- reference training is the practice of diary keeping (DeNisi, Robbins, & Cafferty, 1989), in which supervisors record critical work incidents of both excellent and poor performance by workers. This information can assist the supervisor in the rating process and improve the quality, detail, and credibility of the documentation of a ‚Äúnoticeable‚Äù performance problem. This will not only be more convincing to the subordinate but should also provide the supervisor with greater confidence to initiate a referral. The Pfeiffer Library Volume 20, 2nd Edition. Copyright ¬© 1998 Jossey-Bass/Pfeiffer These methods can be an effective step toward giving supervisors the ability to identify performance problems and can provide the additional benefit of more reliable Once decreased performance is identified, a supervisor faces the difficulty of confronting the worker. This task is so unpleasant that supervisors have been known to inflate ratings in order to justify avoiding such confrontation (Kipnis, 1960; Latham, 1986). This demonstrates the importance of the appraisal issues discussed previously. Training to improve constructive confrontation ability should employ actual demonstration supplemented by consensus-seeking practice and role playing. This type of training should begin with reiteration of the policy issues concerning top management‚Äôs support, documentation of performance, the referral process, etc. This is \n"

A historical controversy has been waged concerning whether the framers of the Fourteenth Amendment intended the word ‚Äúperson‚Äù to mean only natural persons, or whether the word was substituted for the word ‚Äúcitizen‚Äù with a view to protecting corporations from oppressive state legislation.41 As early as the 1877 Granger Cases42 the Supreme Court upheld various regulatory state laws without raising any question as to whether a corporation could advance due process claims.

      "Salve Deus Rex Judaeorum, written by Aemilia Lanyar, was published in 1611. This collection of poems gave readers an insight into the mind of a brilliant woman of her time, making an eloquent defense of all women according to her unique reading of the Bible. In the hopes of establishing a writing career, her collection served another purpose as well: it aimed to attract the support and funding of powerful and influential women, such as Queen Anne of Denmark and Margret Clifford, Countess of Cumberland. Salve Deus Rex Judaeorum is the first and only piece of literature to be published by Aemilia Lanyar and is one of the only works known to be written by an Elizabethan woman (‚ÄúSalve Deus Rex Judaeorum‚Äù). In fact, some scholars speculate that it may have been the first-ever feminist publication in England. The final poem in Lanyar‚Äôs writing was also the first of its kind, being a Country-House poem, one that compliments a wealthy patron through the descriptions of their summer home or country house as the name suggests (‚ÄúCountry House Poem‚Äù). Salve Deus Rex Judaeorum was not likely well-received because it did not gain popularity until many centuries later when it was rediscovered. Today, it widely studied for its content, form, and the satirical tone employed by its captivating author. This version includes ‚ÄúTo the Doubtful Reader,‚Äù ‚ÄúTo the Queen‚Äôs Most Excellent Majesty,‚Äù ‚ÄúTo the Virtuous Reader,‚Äù ‚ÄúEve‚Äôs Apology in Defense of Women,‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Description of Cookham.‚Äù It begins with ‚ÄúTo the Doubtful Reader‚Äù which serves as an explanation for the inspiration of the title of the text. She uses the opportunity to settle any concerns the reader may have and to stress the validity of her arguments. In the original book, this segment was used as a closing statement. Lanyar‚Äôs second poem, ‚ÄúTo the Queen‚Äôs Most Excellent Majesty,‚Äù praises Queen Anne of Denmark for her beauty, and royal virtues, while also making about her enduring humility in spite of her obvious talents and social status. \n"

Linden, Kraemer, and Dedrick (2007) estimate that only $4 of the $299 retail price of an Apple 30 gigabyte video iPod MP3 player is captured in China, where they are assembled and tested by the Taiwan-based ODM contract manufacturer Inventec. The share captured by domestic Chinese companies is even less; probably limited to packaging and local services. This is, in part, because iPods are assembled from components made mostly in other countries, such as the United States, Japan, and Korea. But more important, it is because Apple‚Äîwhich conducts high-level Global Value Chains in the Electronics Industry    277 Figure 7.4 Taiwan, China‚Äôs Production of Desktop and Notebook PCs, 1986‚Äì2006 Source: Kawakami (forthcoming) from the Internet Information Search System, Department of Statistics, design work and software development in-house and orchestrates the product‚Äôs development, production, marketing, and distribution‚Äîis estimated to capture $80 of the sale price. This study also estimates that $83 is captured in the United States by Apple‚Äôs technology suppliers and by retailers.

Despite the strong alliance between lowland Thai groups and indigenous and tribal peoples, direct negotiation with the government failed to produce any results. The issue of indigenous rights over resource management has seen greater progress, with the Community Forestry Bill being developed over the course of the past ten years and presented to the government for consideration in 2000. With years of experience in political lobbying, the Northern Farmers Network and the other organizations sponsoring the Bill succeeded in having the Bill passed by the House of Representatives in late 2001 If the Community Forest Bill were passed by the government in its original form, it would be the strongest legal instrument available to indigenous and tribal peoples for the protection of their rights to their resources and lands. Although it places a considerable burden of proof on indigenous and tribal communities, and provides only for ‚Äúgovernment-approved stewardship‚Äù and not any real recognition of a priori rights, it has the potential to ensure some security of land tenure. However, in April 2002 the Senate saw fit to amend the Bill, removing Article 18 and, with it, the right of communities living in government-declared conservation areas to claim the right, not even to own but simply to manage their community forests. The Senate further restricted and distorted the intention of the Bill by limiting rights to gather forest products and removing the right to change the Such political and legal processes in claiming land and resource rights is one of two strategies employed by indigenous and tribal communities. The second strategy of equal importance is an ongoing effort to establish a general recognition within the Thai public that highland forest communities are capable and responsible managers of the forest resources of the nation.

Sanders said that the ‚Äúextreme modeled scenario‚Äù used in the report ‚Äúcontradicts long-established trends.‚Äù To the contrary, the Climate Science Special Report which provided the scientific foundation for this report actually states that the observed trends over the last 15-20 years are consistent with the higher emission scenarios.

In response to the report, the White House cited a statistic from the US Energy Information Administration ‚Äì since 2005, the country‚Äôs energy-related CO2 emissions have declined by 14 percent, even as global emissions continue to rise. While the statistic itself is accurate, much of that reduction is the result of power plants switching from coal to cleaner burning natural gas over the past decade, according to the EIA. Trump has made reviving the coal industry a key part of his energy policy. In August, the EPA introduced the Affordable Clean Energy rule, which shifted the power to regulate coal power plants‚Äô carbon emissions from the federal government to the states. In September, the EPA released a proposal that would relax requirements for how energy companies monitor and repair methane leaks. In February, 2017, President Trump signed an executive order asking the EPA to review Obama-era water regulations to make sure they were not harming the economy. ‚ÄúI am taking historic steps to lift the restrictions on American energy, to reverse government intrusion and to cancel job-killing regulations,‚Äù said Trump.

      "by the field researcher are not representative of that particular group. The infor- mants used by the researcher may not be typical members of the social setting. Individuals who choose to speak out and share personal histories and openly dis- cuss the activities of the group with the researcher may differ in important ways from other group members. As a result, the field data would be biased by these extreme views. The results of the study would not be an accurate description of this group and would definitely not be generalizable. We return to the complexi- ties of external validity more fully in Chapter 16. Ethical concerns for the field observer include consent and confidentiality. Recall from Chapter 2 that naturalistic observations in public places, such as in a shopping mall or a library, are ethical when participants remain anonymous. In this case, consent is not needed. But what about an ethnographer who conceals his or her identity, infiltrates a group, and conceals the purpose ofthe study? Does this amount to spying on them, collecting data without their consent? The Institu- tional Review Board (IRB) considers possible risks to the participants and decides if the research is sufficiently important to allow the potential invasion of privacy. The IRB also ensures that confidentiality is protected. This issue is of particular concern when private and intimate behaviors are observed, such as drug and al- cohol use, sexual activity, and antisocial behavior. Additional ethical concerns are highlighted in Box 6.3. The field observer should also consider his or her personal ethics. Dan Rose's (1987) study of a Black neighborhood in Philadelphia was con- ducted covertly, against his personal and professional judgment. Rose reports the experience as being very negative, contributing to the IS-year delay in writing his Another source of ethical concern for a participant observer relates to the confidentiality of what is observed. What course of action should observers take \n"

Ms Collins recently responded to a request from NZ First about her China trips under the Official Information Act but Mr Robertson said he had not seen that. Labour had asked some questions to get information in August last year and worked on it further last month. Mr Key said the Cabinet Office did not believe Ms Collins' had endorsed the products. \"The fact the company might write down something, that happens all the time. I go to lots of things where I hold up things or say oh I use your toilet paper or whatever it might be, that's not deemed to be an endorsement.\" Under Parliamentary privilege, he said the situation had echoes of former National MP Pansy Wong who resigned over allegations her husband had used Parliamentary travel perks to fly to China and did business while there - which was against the rules for the use of the perks. Ms Collins said her husband had accompanied her while on an official trip to China in 2012 but had paid for himself and was on holiday. Mr Roberston said Ms Collins had opened the Auckland office of Oravida in 2013 and Oravida donated more than $55,000 to National in 2011. He said National Party president Peter Goodfellow had met with its representatives and was also part owner of Sanfords which supplied fish products to Oravida. \"So knowing all of that, Judith Collins goes to this office and promotes the products of that company. That is a conflict of interest. Judith Collins is not above the rules.\" * Judith Collins visited Oravida in China last year. Her husband is a director. A photo of Collins was put on its website with a caption saying she endorsed its products. It is against Cabinet rules to endorse products, or do anything from which a family member may benefit. "

Her husband, David Wong Tung, is a director of Oravida and the company later put up a photo of Ms Collins claiming she had tasted and endorsed their products. It is against Cabinet Manual rules to endorse any product. Labour MP Grant Robertson said there was a perception of a conflict of interest. \"Ministers have to be up front. Perception matters.'' Ms Collins said she was not aware of the photo and would ask for it to be removed if it breached Cabinet guidelines. \"I certainly don't endorse any products other than the fact I always try and help New Zealand companies trying to export.'' Prime Minister John Key said he did not believe Ms Collins' husband's directorship of Oravida created a conflict of interest. \"It doesn't preclude her dropping in.

       "In July 2015, parliamentary privilege was used to link the export of swamp kauri to Northland and National Party donors and insiders. In Parliament, Labour's MP for Te Tai Tokerau, Kelvin Davis, asked the Government if ministers were \"aware of reports that local wood manufacturers have been refused the opportunity to buy swamp kauri from Kauri Ruakaka mill, which was formerly called Oravida, and is allegedly involved in exporting raw swamp kauri?\" One of the directors of Oravida is National MP Judith Collins' husband, David Wong-Tung. The argument is that Oravida is exporting them to China under the guise of being tables and the money is being funneled into their political affiliations which just happen to include the political party Wong-Tung's wife (Judith Collins) is a prominent member of: National. This was of course denied, and RNZ even [had to write an apology to Oravida] (https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/276363/minister-defends-trade-in-kauri-swamp-logs) at the bottom of their article, saying that they were wrong to suggest Oravida were involved in the export of illegal swamp kauri. FYI.org.nz reports that the OIA request for Judith Collins to speak to her involvement was denied. You can follow the link to see the fuckery used to avoid fulfilling the request. However, when piecing together the company's purpose as Oravida Kauri Ltd, the people involved, and the history of questionable exports, it's quite clear that a proper investigation should have been done and putting it on the shoulders of the contractor seems unfair at best. And then there's Collin's connection as a National MP, her relationship with Oravida, and the donations and connections the company and the party have formed. In September 2017, a digger damaged part of a 168km jet-fuel line which caused tens of millions of dollars in lost business and repairs, grounded dozens of flights and caused havoc on the supply chain.

It also says a perception of a conflict of interest may arise where a family member or friend of a minister could get some benefit from the ministers' actions or decisions. Ms Collins said she had told Oravida in advance that it could not use her name or photograph to endorse or promote its products and had not known about the photo on the website. She had since asked Oravida to ensure it was not claiming she endorsed it, in either English or mandarin. She had tasted the milk and said \"it was nice\" but that did not amount to an endorsement of the company. \"Shock, horror, I drink milk. I promote New Zealand milk anywhere I go. It's the finest milk in the world.\" She said Mr Robertson's claims were \"desperate\" and solely because he was trying to help Labour leader David Cunliffe escape scrutiny for his use of trusts. However, Mr Robertson claimed there was still a clear conflict of interest. \"Going to a company where her husband is a director, having a photo taken and being said to have endorsed the products fits within that conflict.\" Mr Robertson denied he had timed the allegations to detract attention from Mr Cunliffe's campaign funding.

       "Collins says Oravida visit not conflict of interest Judith Collins went on a taxpayer-funded visit to China last year. In her public role as Justice Minister, she was there to talk about our system. But she was also welcomed into a New Zealand export company that her husband has a private interest in. She says the purpose of her visit was ‚Äúto actually have a cup of tea on the way to the airport‚Äù. Ms Collins‚Äô husband, David Wong-Tung, is one of three directors of Oravida ‚Äì a milk and food export company. On its website the company referred to her as the Justice Minister. It says she recognised the company‚Äôs efforts, and ‚Äúcongratulated us on what we have achieved and encouraged us to continue‚Äù. Ms Collins also opened the company‚Äôs Auckland headquarters last year, with Mr Wong-Tung standing behind her. She says it is not an issue that she was effectively promoting the company where her husband is a director. Why isn‚Äôt this getting as much coverage as Cunliffe‚Äôs supposed betrayal of democracy? Judith Collins can‚Äôt wave her connection with her husbands company around much more than adding her name and posting photos with a promotional gulp of milk to support the product. ‚Äúa conflict may arise if people close to a minister, such as a minister‚Äôs family [‚Ä¶] might derive, or be perceived as deriving, some personal, financial, or other benefit from a decision or action by the minister‚Äù. ‚ÄúWhen accepting an invitation, a minister should inform the organisation that it may not use any photos taken of the minister at the event in a way that could be perceived as an endorsement by the minister.‚Äù There‚Äôs not really much wriggle room here is there? Nothing highlights the double standards within the media better than the difference in exposure between Cunliffe‚Äôs sins and what seems to be a Judith‚Äôs massive conflict of interest. I think why there is no coverage is the age old media bias by the owners of the sensationalism carnival ‚Äì no mystery really. Will she be crushed by the weight of her own ego ? I hope so‚Ä¶ "

       "New Zealand water could be the next big export to China and one of the companies that has just jumped in for a slice of the pie is none other than Oravida. The company is only paying a small amount to the council for the millions of litres it can take. Stone Shi and Julia Xu are the brains behind Oravida, and part of Prime Minister John Key's delegation in Beijing. They're now exporting Kiwi water to China as a premium product. \"It has been filtered for many many years, and through the filtration process it carries a lot of great minerals for bodies,\" Ms Xu says. The pair's close personal ties to Judith Collins caused a huge political controversy in 2014. They've now expanded from Scampi and milk, to water from a plant in the Bay of Plenty it bought for an undisclosed sum last year. Oravida has a consent to 146 million litres of ground water a year and the regional council says Oravida pays an annual compliance charge of around $500. Oravida markets the water at $1.60 a litre, meaning if all 146 million litres were sold it could be worth $233 million a year. \"The right to draw water is determined by the local council,\" Ms Xu says. The Prime Minister says water could be the next big thing, saying the market is \"potentially huge\". It's huge because of New Zealand's clean, green image, which Oravida is using as a key selling point. "

       "Oravida is exporting millions of litres of New Zealand water to China, and the Green Party says it is wrong that they are paying practically nothing for it, while potentially making hundreds of millions of dollars. Oravida pays about $500 a year to draw up to 400,000 litres of water a day from the Otakiri Aquifer in Bay of Plenty. This will allow the company to take up to 146 million litres a year from the aquifer until 2026. An Bay of Plenty Regional Council spokesperson said Oravida had paid a total $1503 for the consents since 1992, and last year paid $526 in compliance costs. \"The Resource Management Act 1991 only allows the Regional Council to recover actual and reasonable costs associated with processing and managing resource consent applications to take water,\" she said. Massey University freshwater ecologist Mike Joy said the same thing will keep happening until the government charged for water. \"It's just a free for all for a tiny proportion of New Zealanders, that abuse something that belongs to all of us. Whether they be farmers polluting the water, or taking it out for irrigation, or if it's bottling companies taking it away, the core issue is that we are not putting a price on it.\" Mr Joy said charging users would dramatically improve how efficiently water was used. Greens water issues spokesperson Catherine Delahunty said it was wrong for companies like Oravida to make a profit by exporting this increasingly valuable resource. \"This is happening not only in the Bay of Plenty but all over the country. There's 74 bottling plants. But, when the water is purely for export it means we're giving away that water for nothing, when we may need it in the future.\" Hundreds of people marched in Ashburton on Saturday, protesting against the council there selling off a piece of land with the right to extract 45 litres of water a second from the town's aquifers for the next 30 years.

In many ways, the two could not be more different. Margaret Thatcher is Collins‚Äô political hero. ‚ÄúI like the fact she didn‚Äôt give up when others would have. She didn‚Äôt give in to what other people thought she should do, or be.‚Äù Collins, 61, is a famously tough, take-no-prisoners party stalwart, nicknamed ‚ÄúCrusher Collins‚Äù for her desire to destroy the cherished cars of boy racers. She is also famed for her tough stance on crime, supported the introduction of Tasers to the police force, and argued for officers to have better access to firearms. But there is another side. She is one of the more socially liberal National leaders in recent years, she loathes ‚Äúall forms of racism and sexism‚Äù, voted for the legalisation of same-sex marriage, taking abortion out of the Crimes Act, and legalising euthanasia. She is also an animal tragic who is still grieving the loss of her dog, Holly, euthanised while the country was under effective house-arrest. The leadership of the centre-right National party has eluded Collins for years, despite her evident penchant and suitability for a leadership role. On Tuesday ‚Äì when Todd Muller unexpectedly resigned after 53 days citing health reasons ‚Äì Collins claimed the top job, saying the party had decided her ‚Äústrength and decisiveness‚Äù were what the party needed so close to an election and after a slew of high-profile resignations. Collins may also be the party‚Äôs only hope against the staggering popularity of Ardern. The daughter of Waikato dairy farmers, Collins has long been a decisive political figure in New Zealand‚Äôs otherwise somewhat beige parliament, and in her 18 years in the beehive ‚Äì as the parliamentary building is known ‚Äì she has never been far from the action.

       "Long-serving politician Judith Collins will lead New Zealand's opposition National Party into an election against a popular government in just over two months, taking over from Todd Muller, who quit as leader citing health reasons. Mr Muller shocked politicians in the right-of-centre party saying he was stepping down \"effective immediately.\" The 67-year-old former business executive had led the party for only 53 days, toppling previous leader Simon Bridges in a leadership coup amid National's stagnant polling numbers. Ms Collins was chosen to take over the leadership in a hastily arranged meeting of the party's parliamentary caucus in Wellington on Tuesday evening. She is National's fourth leader in three years and its second female leader. Ms Collins was first elected to Parliament in 2002, serving in governments under prime ministers John Key and Bill English. She held police and corrections portfolios and is seen to represent the right-wing of the National Party, having previously promoted strong law and order policies. Ms Collins now faces the task of trying to rally National's support 67 days from 19 September elections at which it will try to unseat the governing Labour Party of popular Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern. Judith Collins (right) with new deputy leader Gerry Brownlee (left) at New Zealand Parliament in Wellington. Recent polls show Labour with sufficient support to form a majority government, a first since New Zealand adopted a system of proportional representation in 1996. All previous governments since that time have been coalitions and Labour currently governs with the support of the Green Party and right-of-centre New Zealand First led by Winston Peters. Mr Muller's sudden departure forced a scramble of lawmakers to Wellington during a parliamentary recess. Mr Muller said his health made his continuation in the leadership untenable. "

Other than Ardern she is one of the few New Zealand lawmakers whose first name alone would spark recognition with the public. Ben Thomas, a centre-right commentator, said that made her the party‚Äôs only choice. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs the only person in National who is assured enough and polished enough to foot it with Jacinda Ardern,‚Äù he said. Thomas added that the ‚Äúpatricians‚Äù of the party had been unable to ‚Äúgo head to head‚Äù with the prime minister, who often answers the public‚Äôs questions in Facebook Live broadcasts from home and had a 54% preferred prime minister rating in a June poll (her then-rival, Muller, held 13% support). Collins‚Äôs rise came at the end of a horror day for National; its lawmakers had been unaware of what was coming when their leader suddenly announced his resignation, ‚Äúeffective immediately‚Äù by email on Tuesday morning, saying in a statement that his leadership was ‚Äúuntenable from a health perspective‚Äù and had ‚Äútaken a heavy toll‚Äù on him personally. ‚ÄúIt has become clear to me that I am not the best person to be leader of the opposition and leader of the New Zealand National party at this critical time for New Zealand,‚Äù said Muller. ‚ÄúIt is more important than ever that the New Zealand National party has a leader who is comfortable in the role.‚Äù He has made no further comment, has not appeared in public since his resignation, and did not attend Tuesday‚Äôs meeting to select his replacement. In June, shortly after Muller assumed the leadership after ousting his predecessor, National had risen in the polls to just 38% against Labour‚Äôs 50% ‚Äì meaning Ardern‚Äôs party could govern alone.

For the first time since National‚Äôs caucus replaced Don Brash with John Key, the party has chosen a leader who can win. The new Leader of the Opposition is a clear-sighted defender of the neoliberal order who is prepared to give when she needs to give, and takes no prisoners when she doesn‚Äôt. Collins is articulate, shrewd and possesses a disarming (if somewhat cruel) sense of humour. Those on the left who dismiss her as a major electoral turn-off will, almost certainly, be proved wrong. She has what it takes to manoeuvre Jacinda and Labour onto the defensive. And, as everybody knows: explaining is losing. Like Act‚Äôs current collection of strategists, Collins understands that delivering neoliberalism straight leaves voters with a sour taste in their mouths. It goes down much better when fizzed-up with lashings of law-and-order rhetoric ‚Äì along with generous splashes of ‚Äúculture wars‚Äù liqueur. That Collins, herself, happily owns up to being a ‚Äúsocial liberal‚Äù, only adds an extra kick to her political cocktail. It‚Äôs this political ambiguity that makes National‚Äôs new leader so dangerous. Collins does not belong to the crazy Christian Right faction of her caucus, but neither is she a member of the Nikki Kaye, Amy Adams, Chris Bishop ‚Äúsoppy liberal‚Äù wing of the party. (Although she may, from time-to-time, be found voting alongside them.) For a long while now this ambiguity has constituted an unhelpful obstacle to her advancement. With the right rejecting her as too left, and the left dismissing her as too right, she has fallen repeatedly between the two stools. But now, with both factions severely discredited, being a little bit country and a little bit rock-n-roll has proved to be no bad thing at all. When pitted against Jacinda, however, it‚Äôs Collins‚Äô neoliberalism which is likely to prove most deadly. "

Collins, who has long held leadership ambitions but whose party is floundering in the polls, will face an uphill battle to persuade voters away from Ardern, one of the most popular New Zealand prime ministers of all time. Her centre-left Labour party is riding high in the polls after Ardern‚Äôs government quashed the spread of Covid-19 in the country, with many regarding the prime minister as something of a saviour figure. While Collins‚Äôs predecessor had said he would not oppose the government ‚Äúfor opposition‚Äôs sake,‚Äù her ascension sets the stage for a clash of ideologies on the campaign trail: the 61-year-old politician, who has decried the ‚Äúwoke left‚Äù, said in May that she was ‚Äúsick of being demonised‚Äù for being white. ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs important that we give credit where it‚Äôs due,‚Äù she said of Ardern at a news conference after she won a late-night vote on Tuesday. But there was ‚Äúno chance at all that I‚Äôm going to let Jacinda Ardern get away with any nonsense‚Äù. The new party leader was staunch when she took the podium, surrounded by her MPs, after National held a late-night, closed-door vote at New Zealand‚Äôs parliament in Wellington, following the shock resignation on Tuesday morning of Todd Muller. He quit abruptly after leading the party for a volatile 53 days ‚Äì the shortest stint in its history ‚Äì characterised by leaks, distractions, weak interview performances, and rogue MPs. He had ousted the previous leader, Simon Bridges in a coup in May after dismal polling showed a heavy loss for the party in September. "

Thereafter, members of the caucus stood alongside Collins and Brownlee as they addressed media. \"Third time lucky,\" Collins said, referring to the other leadership bids she's made. She said Paul Goldsmith would remain National's finance spokesperson, but couldn't confirm whether Michael Woodhouse would remain health spokesperson. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see major shifts at all in the policies we have,\" she said, stressing there wouldn‚Äôt be ‚Äúwholesale‚Äù policy changes. Collins said the caucus decision not to work with New Zealand First still stood. ‚ÄúI think we need to be very focussed on just sticking to focussing on our party vote, and understanding there are other players coming into politics at this time as well,‚Äù she said. While Muller, and his former deputy Nikki Kaye in particular, were well-placed to target centrist voters, Collins said: ‚ÄúI think it is important that we send some very strong messages out to our base voters, who have been, obviously, a bit discombobulated with the last day or so. They need to know that we‚Äôre absolutely back on track and we will be taking the fight to the Government.‚Äù Asked whether she would adopt the same approach Muller said he would - to not be in ‚Äúopposition for opposition‚Äôs sake‚Äù, Collins responded: ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs important that we give credit where it‚Äôs due, but at the same time there is no chance at all that I‚Äôm going to let Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern get away with any nonsense when it comes to our economy and doing her job.

       "An eye-watering $31 billion is the price tag National has put on the infrastructure upgrade required to fix the country's transport network and Auckland and upper North Island's congestion crisis. In her first big policy announcement today, new National leader Judith Collins delivered the opposition's infrastructure plan - a policy former leader Todd Muller was meant to make before quitting on Tuesday. Collins has also announced a National government would repeal the Resource Management Act completely, and replace it with two new pieces of law. More than half of the money announced by Collins today ($17b) would be invested in the upper north, which Collins said was home to half of all New Zealanders. To fix the congestion issues, Collins announced \"National would go ahead with everything Labour has said it will do in transport\" - with the exception of Transport Minister Phil Twyford's \"light-rail Ghost Trains, and the probable exception of the $360 million Skypath 2\". She said National would also go much further, with some work beginning immediately and the larger projects rolled out over the next decade. One of the most ambitious projects announced was four-lane expressways - including tunnels under the Brynderwyn and Kaimai mountain ranges - to connect WhangƒÅrei, Auckland, Hamilton and Tauranga. \"National's vision is to transform the four cities to be one economic powerhouse, unlocking their potential so the upper North Island becomes Australasia's most dynamic region,'' Collins said. Also part of the announcement is Auckland's rapid transit network, including rail to the airport and new busways. \"One rough definition of a city is that it is a place you can get from one side to the other in an hour, or a place that the average time to get to work is 30 minutes. National will measure our progress against the goals of 30 minutes to get to work and one hour to get across the city,'' Collins said. "

       "I‚Äôve seen a couple of recent political commentaries comparing National‚Äôs new leader Judith Collins to the late former Prime Minister Robert Muldoon who dominated New Zealand politics from the mid 1970‚Äôs to the mid 1980‚Äôs. Certainly the little bit of the first exchange in the house I caught between Collins and P.M. Ardern invites the comparison in the pugnacious political style the new Opposition Leader is projecting. There is also more than an element of the ‚ÄúThink Big ‚Äú project of the Muldoon era in Collins‚Äô plan to bypass the Resource Management Act for huge infrastructure projects such as the proposed four-lane highway from Whangarei to Tauranga and a second Auckland harbour crossing. The idea that you just bulldoze any legislation designed to protect our environment out of the way in the name ‚Äúprogress‚Äù is very Muldoon at his draconian worst. Most Acts of Parliament require review from time to time and the RMA is no exception . Moreover, in my view, Transport is certainly one of those areas where Labour is weakest and therefore most vulnerable to attack from the Right. It does seem to me however, as we watch the issue of traffic congestion especially in Auckland and Wellington being debated in the run up to the election, that we need to think about whether more cars on our roads (be they petrol driven or electric) is really such a great idea. Or whether a radical rethink about how we get from A to B ‚Äì eg. completely free, highly efficient bus, light rail and train services ‚Äì is in order As for Muldoon. I interviewed him on two occasions. He was a highly divisive politician who rolled the job of Finance Minister into that of the Prime Minister and became drunk on power. But, he was something Judith Collins and her current National Party colleagues are not. He was anti-neoliberal. He rejected Treasury‚Äôs advice to follow the economic path of self-centeredness being advocated by Britain‚Äôs then Conservative Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and Republican President Ronald Regan.

       "He is marked down because people do not warm to the way he comes across. Who is to say that they would warm to another leader who was even more aggressive and lacking in charm? There are many qualities other than aggression that voters seek ‚Äì as Jacinda Ardern‚Äôs popularity demonstrates. A leader of the Opposition who was able to mix it in a roughhouse could still be seen as lacking the poise and judgment that would be needed in a Prime Minister. We should never forget that what makes the job of leading the Opposition so difficult is that the holder of that office must be seen not only as an effective and combative critic of the government but also as a potential Prime Minister. It is here that the case for a Judith Collins leadership really starts to crumble. We now know enough about her to doubt whether she is an appropriate, let alone credible, candidate for the top job. A simple rehearsal of some of the high (or perhaps that should be low) points of her political career should be enough to confirm those doubts. Her close relationship with Cameron Slater ‚Äì he of ‚ÄúDirty Politics‚Äù fame ‚Äì should ring the alarm bells; Cameron Slater regards her as his mentor in the black arts and has said as much. Her refusal to recognise the conflict of interest implicit in a dinner with her husband‚Äôs firm, Oravida, when on a taxpayer-paid ministerial visit to China was compounded by the misinformation she offered to explain the visit she paid to its offices ‚Äì it was, she said, simply for a ‚Äúcup of tea on the way to the airport‚Äù, when the airport was actually in the opposite direction. These malfeasances obliged both the Speaker and John Key, when Prime Minister, to reprimand her and stand her down. These elements strongly suggest that what might be seen by her supporters as a commendable willingness to cut corners and to ‚Äúget down and dirty‚Äù should actually disqualify her from offering herself as a potential Prime Minister.

       "Judith Collins is the new leader of National after the party accepted Todd Muller's resignation and backed her to take over on Tuesday. It's been a tumultuous road to the helm for Collins, a role she's put herself forward for twice before - one fraught with resignations, troublesome tweets and Dirty Politics. But she's arrived now, and believes there are no skeletons left in the closet. \"If anyone's gone through having all their emails gone through, all their phone records and everything else for years‚Ä¶ I think we're perfectly fine,\" she told Magic Talk on Wednesday. \"If someone wants to try something, fine. I'm ready for them. I'm focused on the people of New Zealand, I'm not worrying about the sort of muckrakers we've dealt with in the past.\" Need a reminder of what Collins has dished up in the past? Below are the biggest controversies of her political career. Judith Collins was accused in 2014 of a conflict of interest with Oravida bosses - a company where her husband was a director - and a Chinese official. During a taxpayer-funded visit to China in her role as Justice Minister in 2013, Collins was welcomed into the New Zealand export company and endorsed the milk it produced. Prime Minister John Key criticised the visit, causing Collins to apologise. However she said the Chinese official - who she refused to name - was a \"very close personal friend\". She also claimed it was \"not necessarily true\" that her husband would benefit financially from the company doing well, as he wasn't a shareholder. Key told media Collins was on her final warning over the incident - but she maintained she had Key's permission to meet with the company. Also in 2014, Collins found herself embroiled in the scandal sparked by Nicky Hager's Dirty Politics - an explosive book that had an entire chapter devoted to her alleged unscrupulous tactics. "
