       "  'The king’s money: Thailand divided over the $40bn question\\nRoula Khalaf, Editor of the FT, selects her favourite stories in this weekly newsletter.\\nFor such a big change it was a very small announcement. An unscheduled communiqué published on its website on Saturday June 16 2018 revealed that Thailand’s Crown Property Bureau had transferred its entire portfolio — royal assets worth tens of billions of dollars held for more than 80 years on behalf of the monarchy and the nation — into the hands of the new King Maha Vajiralongkorn.\\n“All Crown Property assets are to be transferred and revert to the ownership of His Majesty so that they may be administered and managed at His Majesty’s discretion,” the CPB said, clarifying the details of a crown property law passed the previous year.\\nIt added that the assets would “now be held in the name of His Majesty” and be subject to tax.\\nIt was an extraordinary move. Thailand’s royal wealth portfolio is estimated to be worth more than $40bn.\\nIn addition to swaths of prime real estate in downtown Bangkok, the CPB owns large stakes in the kingdom’s biggest industrial company, Siam Cement Group, and one of its largest lenders, Siam Commercial Bank.\\nThe transfer of ownership from the CPB to the personal control of the king confirmed him as one of the world’s richest monarchs.\\nStrict restrictions on what can and can’t be said about Thailand’s royal family — most notably a lèse majesté law that carries a maximum 15-year jail term for saying or writing anything that might be construed as an insult — meant that the transfer of ownership was barely reported.\\nNobody, including the Financial Times, questioned why it was necessary or raised concerns about the concentration of financial power in Thailand’s current head of state.\\nBut two years later, amid a wave of nationwide protests, Thais are breaking their silence over the 68-year-old king’s wealth and the generous public budgets enjoyed by royal institutions.\\nStudent protesters are asking why public funds are being handed to a king who spends more time in Germany than he does in Thailand — an issue most Thai media avoid mentioning.\\nA 10-point manifesto demanding reforms to the monarchy calls for a cut in the royal budget “in keeping with the country’s economic situation” — a nod to the coronavirus pandemic — as well as an end to royal charity projects, which receive taxpayer funds, and the separation of the king’s personal wealth from crown assets.\\n“It’s the biggest issue of all in Thailand,” says Parit “Penguin” Chiwarak, one of the most radical of the student protesters in pressing for royal reforms.\\n“The royal institution can interfere in politics because they have enough money.\\n“If we don’t say it now, when are we going to say it?”\\nIt is hard to overstate the impact of these criticisms in a country where the royal family was until recently viewed as untouchable.\\nBut precedents are being broken by an outspoken and, to many Thais, radical group of young leaders who are questioning the foundations of Thailand’s political order.\\nIn a provocative move in September they laid a plaque near the royal palace stating Thailand “belongs to the people, not the king as they deceived us”.\\nAnon Nampa, a senior protest leader, calls the royal budget “excessive” and says it has been “unnecessarily increased”.\\nThe focus on the king’s wealth comes as Thai authorities, who have managed to restrict coronavirus at just over 3,600 reported cases, are now confronting the economic fallout, which has left millions unemployed and hurt an economy heavily reliant on tourism and exports.\\nAt a rally on September 20, Mr Parit called for a boycott of Siam Commercial Bank, which he called “a money pot of feudalism”.\\n“You are replenishing money for the German,” he said, using the name some anti-government Thais use for the king.\\n“Close your SCB account, get all your money out, and burn your bank book.”\\nThailand’s central bank was quick to say the next day that it had noticed no surge in withdrawals from SCB.\\nIn a country without reliable opinion polling, it is impossible to gauge the level of support for the students’ call for scrutiny of royal money and finances, but it is safe to say that the monarchy and political status quo enjoy significant backing.\\nMany Thais, even those who oppose Prayuth Chan-ocha’s military-backed government, think the students have overplayed their hand with the calls to curb the monarchy’s powers, and that they are entering dangerous territory in a country with a history of coups and political bloodshed.\\nSupport for the protests will be tested on Wednesday, when the students plan their next big demonstration.\\nThey have spoken of marching to Government House to press for the resignation of the Prayuth government and “seizing” back the Democracy Monument in central Bangkok.\\nThe students’ frankness has emboldened other Thais. MPs from Move Forward, formerly Future Forward, Thailand’s most outspoken opposition party, have been using their powers in parliament to probe spending on royal institutions.\\nThey point out that it has risen sharply since the king took the throne after his father King Bhumibol Adulyadej died in 2016.\\nMeanwhile, Heiko Maas, Germany’s foreign minister, last week raised the issue of the king’s residence in the country, reflecting growing discomfort in Berlin as protests escalate in Thailand.\\n“We have made it clear that politics concerning Thailand should not be conducted from German soil,” Mr Maas said in response to an MP’s question in the Bundestag.\\n“If there are guests in our country that conduct their state business from our soil, we would always want to act to counteract that.”\\nWhile the Thai king spends most of his time in Germany, he has taken firm steps to consolidate the power and wealth of royal institutions back in Bangkok since ascending to the throne.\\nIn 2017, the year the law on crown property assets was passed, the king combined the former royal household office with the privy council and a royal personal safety body to create a single Royal Office.\\nLast year he issued a decree transferring two army regiments to the Royal Office, putting them under his direct control.\\nUntil this year, Thais — even opponents of the Prayuth government — avoided criticising the king’s role in Thailand’s status quo.\\nBut as near daily protests broke out across Thailand in August, Move Forward MPs used their seats on the budget committee of Thailand’s lower house to query royal spending.\\n“It’s taxpayers’ money, it has to be transparent,” says Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit, who led Future Forward before authorities dissolved the party in February, but acts as an adviser to the committee.\\nAccording to Thailand’s budget, spending on the Royal Office is set to reach nearly 9bn baht ($290m) this year, more than double the Bt4.2bn budgeted in 2018, its first full year of operation.\\nMove Forward also questioned royal spending paid by other government departments, including Bt1.2bn from the defence ministry and Bt1.6bn from the Thai police for royal security, and\\nBt7bn budgeted for royal development projects, charitable endeavours that receive taxpayer money. The party also queried the Royal Office’s use of aircraft, and were given by Mr Prayuth’s office an inventory of 38 planes and helicopters reserved for royal use.\\nMr Thanathorn is also critical of the transfer of royal assets to the king, pointing out that he is now a leading corporate shareholder via the CPB’s stakes in SCG and SCB, and yet enjoys elevated legal status.\\n“The king is now a player in the market,” he says. “It’s just wrong. It’s undemocratic.”\\nEstimate of the value of assets held by Thailand’s Crown Property Bureau\\n2011 estimate of the property assets under the CPB’s control published in a book on the late King Bhumibol\\nSpending on the Royal Office this year, more than double the amount budgeted in 2018\\nPlanes and helicopters reserved for royal use, MPs on the budget committee of Thailand’s lower house were told\\nThe CPB, akin to a sovereign wealth fund, had its origins in the Privy Purse Bureau, a body devoted to the upkeep of royal family members that began to invest in Siam’s economy as it was modernising more than a century ago.\\nIn the 1930s, after the uprising that made Thailand — as it was later renamed — a constitutional monarchy, the CPB was established, with a clear division between the king’s personal assets and royal ones.\\nAs Thailand’s economy was taking off in the 1980s, the fund became a leading investor in the stock exchange and industry.\\nThe CPB was chaired by the finance minister until 2018, when the king appointed as its head air chief marshal Satitpong Sukvimol, who now also chairs SCG.\\n“The demands by protesters to audit the king’s finances are unprecedented,” says Tamara Loos, a professor of history and south-east Asian studies at Cornell University.\\n“But so is the way the king utilises what were formerly state funds.”\\nEstimating the value of the king’s wealth is largely a matter of guesswork, as no full inventory of the monarchy’s assets is publicly available.\\nThe CPB last published an annual report in 2017 that included investment projects such as Langsuan Village (later renamed Sindhorn Village), a luxury real estate and retail development in Bangkok’s central business district, and the fund’s public works and charitable projects.\\nThe king’s corporate assets are easier to value: he owns a 23.4 per cent stake in Siam Commercial Bank, worth $1.7bn, and 33.6 per cent of Siam Cement Group, valued at $4.5bn.\\nHowever, the CPB’s biggest asset is real estate, mostly in Bangkok, but also in Thailand’s central plains and other regions.\\nA 2011 semi-official biography of the late king, King Bhumibol Adulyadej: a Life’s Work, whose authors were given access to CPB officials, estimated that the Bangkok real estate portfolio alone was worth about $33bn at the time, and added that a “high estimate” of the assets under the CPB’s control was about $37bn.\\nAt the time the bureau owned 3,230 acres in Bangkok and another 13,200 acres outside the capital, according to the book.\\n“If such wealth belonged to an individual, he or she would rank in the top six on the Forbes list of the world’s billionaires,” the book said.\\n“But this wealth does not belong to an individual. It belongs to the crown.”\\nSince the king took ownership of CPB assets, that has not been the case. Thailand’s property market has been buoyant in the decade since, although the pandemic has caused demand and prices to fall.\\nThailand’s government pushes back when journalists, including the FT, try to estimate royal wealth or refer to the billions of dollars of assets the king owns.\\nIn 2012, when Forbes, which the previous year had declared Bhumibol as the world’s richest monarch, published a piece on “His Majesty’s balance sheet” and estimated the king’s fortune at more than $30bn, the Thai embassy in Washington criticised the magazine for including CPB assets “held in trust for the nation” into its calculation of his personal wealth.\\nThailand’s foreign ministry declined to comment and a government spokesman did not respond to a request for comment.\\nWhen the FT made reference to the king’s wealth in a recent story, the Thai embassy in London wrote to the newspaper saying: “The claim that His Majesty the King is in charge of billions of dollars of wealth is unfounded.”\\nThe letter noted the CPB was “managed by a board of directors” who worked towards “maintaining a balance between financial stability of the assets as well as generating social incomes to benefit all stakeholders”.\\nInterest in King Vajiralongkorn’s residence in Germany — a staple for local media — has intensified recently as officials asked awkward questions not only about the king’s political role, but also the tax implications of his stay.\\nAccording to local politicians, the monarch was living in a villa at Tutzing near Lake Starnberg, about 40km from Munich, at the time of his father’s death.\\nMore recently, German media have reported extensively that the king is renting a hotel in Garmisch-Partenkirchen in the Bavarian Alps.\\nIn April two Green party MPs in Bavaria’s state legislature, Claudia Köhler and Tim Pargent, posed written questions to the state government as to whether the king might have been liable for inheritance tax.\\nThe Bavarian government, in its replies, cited German privacy protections surrounding tax and “the state interests of foreign affairs”.\\nHowever, Mr Pargent says he established that the king would have been liable for inheritance tax. Diplomats are immune, but the Thai king is not a diplomat and his residence in Tutzing is not a consulate, according to the MP.\\n“The issue is covered by tax secrecy,” Mr Pargent says. “I am not expecting a final answer through official channels.\\nHowever, through our questions we were at least able to shine a bit of light on the matter.”\\nIn Bangkok, Mr Thanathorn and MPs from his former party have exhausted their inquiries for the current budget round.\\nBut, they say they will take up the matter of royal spending again next year.\\nOne thing that is transparent, the opposition figure says, is the status of royal assets. “In 2018, they made it clear, without question, who the CPB belongs to.”',\n",

       "  'The reporting on this story was done in partnership with the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting.\\nBANGKOK — A few years ago, a Facebook video went viral and revealed to the world why many people in Thailand were anxious over the prospect of Maha Vajiralongkorn, then the country’s crown prince, becoming king.\\nThe film showed the then-64-year-old Vajiralongkorn roaming a shopping mall in Munich, Germany, where he lived most of the time, accompanied not by his wife but his mistress.\\nHe was eating ice cream while wearing very un-monarchical jeans and a crop top, his bare midriff displaying what seemed to be elaborate temporary tattoos.\\nIn Thai society, the king is a figure of inestimable importance, a Hindu-Buddhist paragon of presumed dignity, virtue, and morality — none of which Vajiralongkorn seemed to be exhibiting on his stroll through the mall.\\nWith King Bhumibol Adulyadej old and ailing, many worried the Thai monarchy would atrophy into irrelevance once his playboy son ascended to the throne.\\nAnd given its importance as a pillar of Thai nationhood and identity, that could be disastrous in a country already prone to deep divisions and political turmoil.\\nBut things have decidedly not worked out that way.\\nSince taking the throne in late 2016, Vajiralongkorn has rapidly amassed power. He’s gotten changes in the constitution giving him emergency powers and allowing him to exercise his authority even when he is out of the country — which is most of the time.\\nHe’s taken control of an estimated $43 billion in royal assets that have for decades been entrusted to a Crown Property Bureau that, at least theoretically, managed the money for the benefit of the Thai people.\\nHe’s arranged for units of the army to report directly to him.\\nVajiralongkorn’s assertion of his power comes at a time when Thailand has been moving in an authoritarian direction, the government largely controlled by the military, which, after years of sometimes violent political turmoil, took power in a coup in 2014.\\nA new constitution written by the coup leaders allowed an election to take place in March 2019, but the new law gives the military so many automatic seats in parliament that it would be almost impossible for an opposition party to take control.\\nThe Thai military government has always used a mandatory reverence for the monarchy as a tool of political control, and has carefully cultivated a very monarchical image for the new king.\\nThe man once infamous for his mistresses, crop tops, and presumably fake tattoos now looks out sternly from portraits placed all over Thailand, dressed in kingly gold-brocaded robes or a trim white jacket with epaulets, a yellow sash, and a sword.\\nVajiralongkorn is still a bit of an absentee monarch, living mostly in Europe. But that doesn’t mean he’s detached from politics back home.\\nHe has clearly taken charge, doing so in a way that implicitly affirms both obedience to authority and a kind of above-the-law monarchical privilege.\\n“I thought that Thailand would end up having a weak king,” Pavin Chachavalpongpun, a scholar of Thai politics and a dissident exiled from the country when Vajiralongkorn’s father was still king, told me in a Skype interview from Japan, where he lives.\\n“I thought that Vajiralongkorn would be so lacking in moral authority that he wouldn’t get the support of the various sectors of society that he needs.\\nBut I was wrong,” Chachavalpongpun continued. “He is basically running the country now, though he’s not doing that like his father did through moral authority.\\nHe’s using fear to solidify his position and to take command.”\\nThe incident that has attracted the most attention in the new king’s reign so far involved the woman walking next to Vajiralongkorn in that shopping mall video, a former nurse named Sineenat Wongvajirapakdi.\\nAfter taking the throne, Vajiralongkorn had her recognized as noble royal consort, meaning that she would be a sort of official concubine — a second female companion to the king in addition to his actual wife (his fourth).\\nIn a country where polygamy has been banned for 100 years, the king seemed to be saying that a kind of polygamy would be a prerogative of the monarch (and nobody else).\\nBut then things got even stranger. Just three months later, as if to show the dangers of incurring the king’s disfavor, Sineenat was accused of ingratitude and misbehavior and stripped of her rank and titles.\\nThe universally held belief in Bangkok is that she was thrown into the Bangkok women’s prison; on exactly what legal authority other than the king’s demand, nobody is saying.\\nAround the same time, several palace aides were dismissed — two of them, identified as bedroom guards, for “inappropriate acts and adultery,” according to the official Palace Gazette.\\nIt wasn’t lost on many Thais that the king himself had five children with a now-dismissed mistress while he was still married to his second wife (that mistress and four of the five children have since been disowned and are now living in the United States; the youngest child and only daughter lives in Thailand as a royal).\\nBut in a way, that was the point: Like President Trump, Vajiralongkorn gets away with things that would have ruined his predecessors, though in Vajiralongkorn’s case, this involves an intentional display of royal power, a signal that the rules that apply to everybody else don’t apply to him.\\nIt would be hard to overstate the extent of what seems to be an almost medieval reverence for the king in Thailand.\\nEven the most senior officials in the government and the military literally drop to their knees when in his presence.\\nWhen Sineenat was installed for her brief reign as noble royal consort, official photographs of the ceremony showed her lying on the floor, making hand gestures of fealty, while Vajiralongkorn sat imperiously on a gilded throne above her.\\nThe reverence for the king has long been enforced by the country’s lèse-majesté laws, which outlaw “defaming, insulting, or threatening” of a member of the royal family — including, for example, “Liking” that mall video on Facebook.\\nSince the military coup of 2014, at least 68 people have been arrested or imprisoned under these laws, according to Human Rights Watch.\\nIn what seemed to be a concession to modern sensibilities, Vajiralongkorn, according to newspaper reports, has ordered an end to prosecutions under the lèse-majesté laws.\\nBut human rights groups say that, instead, similar prosecutions are taking place under the country’s computer crime laws.\\nIt’s clear that nobody wants to be heard saying anything negative or derogatory about Vajiralongkorn.\\nThailand is a country where there can be lively conversations about all sorts of topics, where some new political parties have formed to vigorously contest the national elections held in March last year.\\nBut when the subject turns to the king, most people lapse into an awkward silence or, if they do say something, look cautiously around them to make sure no unknown person is listening.\\n“We’re not supposed to talk about the king,” one person whispered to me in Bangkok during a visit there in November, “but the king is what everybody talks about.”\\nInstalling his mistress as a royal consort was certainly scandalous, but some of the measures Vajiralongkorn has taken to assert his power go well beyond nasty palace intrigue and into unprecedented territory for Thailand.\\nHis removal of two crack army regiments in the Bangkok area from the usual chain of command and putting them under his own authority is among them.\\nIn effect, it gives him control of a personal private army. Thais who know about such things say his army is equipped with armored personnel carriers, anti-riot gear, and helicopters.\\nA private army would be very useful if there were ever a coup attempt, including a move against him from some dissenting faction in the army.\\nIn perhaps his most remarkable display of unrestricted power, after a new constitution was adopted in a referendum, Vajiralongkorn simply rewrote the clauses having to do with the power of the king.\\nIn one of them, for example, he eliminated a requirement that when the king is out of the country, which Vajiralongkorn is most of the time, his authority would revert to a regent.\\nHe’s also embarked on a massive building campaign in the central Dusit district of Bangkok, where the monarchy holds real estate of such dimensions as to make the British royal family’s compounds seem small.\\nThis has included closing areas that were once open to the public, including the Bangkok Zoo and one of Bangkok’s two horse-racing tracks.\\nI hired a car to look at the royal compound, though it’s not easy to get glimpses inside.\\nIt’s an immense rectangle, surrounded by newly renovated walls surmounted by the yellow flag of the monarchy.\\nSoldiers patrol the sidewalks alongside. Construction cranes loom over the ramparts. In one area, a row of large buildings that once housed senior members of the palace staff are empty and decaying, reportedly awaiting demolition.\\nThe gates to the old zoo are locked shut. A glimpse into the old race track revealed a bunch of construction sheds.\\nPlaques that once memorialized the 1932 coup that abolished the absolute monarchy have, according to some Bangkok residents, simply disappeared.\\n“It’s all a way of making his power formal, visible,” one person whispered to me. “He wants everybody to see, whether it’s taking back the land that the zoo is on or assuming direct control of military regiments.\\nAll of this would be far more difficult, maybe even impossible, if there were widespread public opposition.\\nBut there seems to be very little of that in Thailand these days.\\nThis is partly because of skillfully applied measures of repression by the military-led government, including the disappearances and apparent killings of at least eight leading opposition figures, and surveillance of others the police feel might cause trouble.\\nThailand is a place where journalists, civic activists, lawyers, and others are summoned to a military base for “attitude adjustment,” as the well-known euphemism would have it.\\n“Some people have gone to jail,” Sirapop Kornaroot, known as Rungsila, a dissident poet recently released after five years of detention, told me.\\n“That’s the way they keep control. That’s the way they make people give up.”\\nBut, as Rungsila and people like him acknowledge, Thailand’s turn to authoritarianism has also been welcomed and supported by many people who experienced the intermittent turbulence and violence of the years before the 2014 coup, and who give credit to the military and the monarchy for the return of domestic “peace and order,” as the propaganda put it at the time.\\nVajiralongkorn, in this sense, arrives at a time of disillusionment with the old politics.\\nIndeed, the old politics was breeding such extreme conflict that Thailand was in danger of civil war.\\nIt started in 2001 when a rich, charismatic populist, Thaksin Shinawatra, was elected prime minister via overwhelming support from the rural poor in the north and northeast of the country.\\nThaksin put into place several programs, like low-cost universal health care, aimed at alleviating rural poverty and appealing to his base.\\nBut he also gave rise to a kind of middle- and upper-class terror that he was dictatorial and corrupt, and that his populist appeal challenged the sustained privilege of wealthy Bangkok elites.\\nA furious opposition emerged, known as the Yellow Shirts — yellow being the color of the monarchy — whose claim to legitimacy was that they, with support from the military, were the defenders of the monarchy.\\nA military coup, the first of two in eight years, removed Thaksin from power in 2006, and shortly after that, facing trial on charges of corruption, he fled the country and has not been back since.\\n“Regarding Thaksin, it had to be either a coup or an assassination,” a former moderate Thai member of parliament told me in 2014, expressing the commonly held middle- and upper-class fear that even though Thaksin had been legally elected, he would turn out to be a dictator impossible to remove.\\nStill, whenever new elections were held, Thaksin’s party won them handily, and when those governments were ousted, Thaksin’s ardent supporters, known as the Red Shirts, mounted huge counter-demonstrations.\\nIn the largest of them, in 2010, the Red Shirts occupied the commercial center of Bangkok for nearly three months before they were crushed by the army, with some 80 Red Shirts killed and more than 2,000 injured.\\nBut in new elections in 2011, the pro-Thaksin party won again in a landslide, and Thaksin’s sister, Yingluck Shinawatra, became prime minister.\\nTwo years later, huge Yellow Shirt demonstrations took place.\\nYingluck was accused of corruption and removed from office in 2014, and with new Red Shirt protests looming and the old, much-loved king, Bhumibol, on his deathbed, the military stepped in, seizing power in a coup and then assuring the royal succession when Bhumibol died two years later.\\n“Actually, the 2014 coup was a way for the military to assure Vajiralongkorn’s succession at a time when his father was sick and Thaksin was becoming more popular than the king,” Pavin said.\\n“There’s a mutual interdependence between the military and the monarchy. Neither can be as strong as it is without the other.”\\n“He’s not the kind of person to voluntarily relinquish any of his power,” Pavin said. “When he came to the throne, he looked at the past ... and he said, ‘Why should I let any of that go?’”\\nVajiralongkorn is clearly a product of Thai culture, but his evident authoritarianism also seems to fit a larger regional and even global pattern, the disillusionment with traditional liberal elites and the turn to strongman rule.\\nIndeed, it’s difficult these days to think of a single country in Southeast Asia, with its 620 million people, that is becoming more democratic rather than more authoritarian.\\nIn the Philippines, for example, President Rodrigo Duterte has emerged as a sort of elected strongman, carrying out a supposed war on drugs that has resulted, according to human rights groups, in more than 20,000 extrajudicial killings.\\nIn Thailand’s neighbor, Myanmar, the military has allowed elections but retains its hold on power, and even the country’s ostensible democratic champion, Aung San Suu Kyi, has supported her government’s genocidal attacks on its Rohingya minority.\\nMeanwhile, in Cambodia, the long-serving prime minister, Hun Sen, has jailed his main political opponents and banned the only political party that had a chance to defeat him in elections two years ago.\\nAll of these countries have retained what a Filipino journalist, Marites Vitug, called “the trappings of power” in a conversation I had with her in Manila.\\nThey have elections, some independent newspapers that even do good critical reporting, and while they do not hesitate to get rid of opponents, they also keep disappearances at low levels so as not to arouse public animosity or international sanction.\\nAll four countries have another thing in common, namely close and cordial relations with nearby authoritarian China, which has used its power and wealth to promote authoritarianism throughout its region.\\nIt does this by refusing to criticize these countries for human rights violations, by offering aid and military support when such support is withheld by the US and Europe, and, not least, by presenting a model that seems to be successful and that China itself proclaims as an alternative to Western ways of doing things.\\n“For the Chinese, it’s easier to deal with strongmen than with democratic governments,” one Thai businessman told me in Bangkok.\\n“Take the Belt and Road project,” he said, referring to Beijing’s plan for a network of ports, railroads, energy corridors, and shipping lanes aimed at making China the center of a vast Eurasian economic network.\\n“It can only be successful if there are no popular protests against it, and the easiest way to achieve this is to deal with strongmen in each country.”\\nAnother Thai, a young political activist in the country’s Democratic Party who ran unsuccessfully for a seat in parliament in the elections last March, told me, “The fact that there’s a new superpower that’s less keen on human rights in other countries reduces the American influence.\\nThe threat of the US withdrawing its support is less serious.”\\n“China is not democratic,” he continued, “but it’s able to deliver fast economic growth, and people feel that if this can happen, what’s the need for democracy?”\\nWhere does Vajiralongkorn fit into this? The Thai monarchy has never been a powerful or outspoken champion of democracy, but many Thais believed the king’s late father, Bhumibol Adulyadej, tried to soften the harshness of military rule.\\nAnd whether he really did that or not, he cultivated an image of Buddhist kindness and compassion, sponsoring programs in the countryside, going to villages and meeting with ordinary people.\\nVajiralongkorn does none of that, cultivating instead an image of sternness, command, and Olympian distance from ordinary people.\\nIf there were people hoping somehow that, being a Western-educated, cosmopolitan person living mostly in the West, he would encourage a move back in the direction of liberal values and practices, they have by now been disappointed.\\nBut there is a deep and wide respect for the institution of the monarchy in Thailand that will no doubt help him, as well as the military factions that support him.\\nTo get a sense of that, I spent a day in November in an area of fish farms and rice paddies in Chachoengsao province southwest of Bangkok to talk to members of an environmental group opposed to a planned industrial zone called the Eastern Economic Corridor.\\nOne of the leaders of the protests, a local fish farmer named Sarayoot Souraksa, described in succinct terms how people in the region of 4 million people felt about the country’s past turmoil and the coup that put an end to it.\\n“They supported the Yellow Shirts,” he said, “because they were afraid of Thaksin coming back.” We were sitting in a covered yard alongside one of his ponds, where he grows plankton for sale to nearby fish and shrimp farmers.\\n“Any other reasons they support the government?” I asked. “Yes,” he replied. “They are royalists.”\\nAnd so, following the election, the former army chief who led the 2014 coup, Prayuth Chan-ocha, became the country’s prime minister.\\nAnd that’s the situation in which the new king has been asserting his authority.\\nRichard Bernstein is a former foreign correspondent at Time magazine and the New York Times.

       "  'In the past months, Vajiralongkorn has vigorously intervened in the political domain.

Yearning for a quiet life in Germany, Vajiralongkorn soon discovered the aggression and intrusion of the European media.\\nHe has been constantly hounded by the paparazzi. On at least two occasions, images of him and his mistress in skinny tank tops revealing massive fake tattoos on their bodies emerged on the internet and appeared on the cover of a German tabloid.\\nThese photos and video clips undoubtedly damaged the reputation of the newly crowned monarch and shook the political stance of the junta.\\nIt prompted the military government to introduce drastic solutions to stop the proliferation of the video clip and photos — threatening to block access to Facebook in Thailand and banning prominent critics of the monarchy.\\nAccordingly, the Ministry of Digital Economy and Society issued an order in April this year prohibiting Thais from contacting three critics of the monarchy — historian Somsak Jeamteerasakul, ex-journalist Andrew MacGregor Marshall and me.\\nThais were told not to befriend or follow us on Facebook, as well as not to click ‘Like’ or share our content online.\\nThose violating the order could be charged with lese majeste, a crime of injury to royalty punishable by 3 to 15 years in prison.\\nShortly after the issuance of the order on 3 May, six Thais were arrested and charged with lese majeste.\\nAmong them were university professor Saran Samantarat and well-known lawyer Prawet Prapanukul. The lese majeste law, as defined by Article 112 of the Criminal Code, has consistently been employed to attack enemies of the royal institution.\\nThis pattern of repression over the years has become normalised as a vicious device used to undermine opponents.\\nBut overusing the law could be counterproductive to the military government and the monarchy itself.

He was charismatic, divine and enjoyed moral authority.

       "  'Thailand\\'s King Vajiralongkorn - his name means \"adorned with jewels or thunderbolts\" - was born on 28 July 1952, the first son and second child of Queen Sirikit and King Bhumibol Adulyadej, who had succeeded to the throne unexpectedly six years previously.\\nAfter decades of uncertainty over royal succession, the birth of a male heir was seen as vital for the monarchy, at a time when its primacy in Thailand\\'s political hierarchy was uncertain.\\nThe absolute monarchy had been overthrown in 1932, followed by an abdication in 1935, and 11 years in which the country had no sitting king.\\nIn King Vajiralongkorn\\'s early years he was educated at a palace school in Bangkok. At the age of 13 he was sent to two private schools in the UK for five years, and then for a final year at a school in Sydney, Australia.\\nHe spent the following four years being trained at the Royal Military College, Duntroon, in Canberra.\\nBy his own account, he struggled to keep up at school, blaming his pampered upbringing in the palace.\\nHe also found it hard to make the grade at Duntroon.\\nHe continued to receive advanced military training in Thailand, the UK, US and Australia, and became an officer in the Thai armed forces.\\nHe is a qualified civilian and fighter pilot, flying his own Boeing 737 when he travels overseas.\\nHe was formally given the title of Crown Prince by his father in an investiture ceremony in 1972, making him the official heir.\\nBut by that time questions were being raised about his fitness to succeed to the throne.\\nHe showed none of the enthusiasm of his younger sister Princess Sirindhorn for his father\\'s development projects and there were persistent rumours of womanising, gambling and illegal businesses.\\nIn 1981 his mother, Queen Sirikit, alluded to these problems, describing her son as \"a bit of a Don Juan\" and suggesting that he preferred spending his weekends with beautiful women rather than performing duties.\\nIn a rare audience with Thai journalists in 1992, he denied the rumours that he was involved with mafia-like figures and underworld businesses.\\nIn 1977 he married his cousin Princess Soamsawali and they had their first child, Princess Bajarakitiyabha, in December 1978.\\nHowever, by then he was involved with a young actress, Yuvadhida, with whom he had five children from 1979 to 1987.\\nHe married her in 1994, but in 1996 very publicly denounced her and disowned his four sons, who were studying in the UK.\\nHe married his third wife Srirasmi, a lady-in-waiting, in 2001, and had another son, Prince Dipangkorn, with her in 2005.\\nIn 2014 Srirasmi was stripped of her royal title and nine of her relatives, including her parents, were arrested for lese majeste on charges they had abused their connections with the Crown Prince.\\nA police officer linked to the family died in custody after falling from a window.\\nThat charge, of abusing his name, has also been made against others who became close to the Crown Prince, notably a well known fortune teller who, together with another police officer, died after being arrested in 2015.\\nAt the same time, the Crown Prince\\'s personal bodyguard was stripped of his rank for \"disobeying royal commands\" and \"threatening the monarchy by pursuing his own interests\".\\nFor years he has been seen in the company of a former Thai Airways flight attendant, Suthida, who was made an officer of the Royal Household Guard, with the rank of Lieutenant-General.\\nHe also famously promoted his pet poodle Fu-Fu to the rank of Air Chief Marshall.\\nIn May 2019, days before his coronation, King Vajiralongkorn married her and the palace announced that she was to become Queen Suthida and will hold royal title and status as part of the royal family.\\nThe severity of the lese majeste law has prevented any open discussion of the new king\\'s suitability inside Thailand.\\nBut privately, the possibility of Vajiralongkorn being passed over for his more popular and dutiful sister Sirindhorn was often talked about, encouraged by her own royal title being elevated in 1978 and by a change in palace succession law to allow a female to succeed to the throne.\\nBut that is only possible where there is no male heir, and King Bhumibol never supported the option of an alternative to his son.\\nAs King Bhumibol\\'s health declined, Crown Prince Vajiralongkorn began to be seen more often in public, performing traditional royal rituals on behalf of his father.\\nIn the past there were rumours of a business relationship between him and former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, the telecoms tycoon whose party has won every election since 2001 and who was seen as a threat by much of the conservative royalist elite.\\nBut after the coup in 2014, which deposed the government of Thaksin\\'s sister Yingluck, the new military rulers appeared to work with the Crown Prince to ensure his succession, helping organise events like mass bicycle rides in which he and his daughters participated, presenting a less formal image of the future king to the public.\\nJust what kind of king Vajiralongkorn will make is hard to guess.\\nAlthough a constitutional monarch, he will wield considerable power - for example, it is almost impossible for anyone in Thailand to reject the express wishes of the monarch.\\nHe also has a decisive say over the Crown Property Bureau, by far the wealthiest institution in Thailand, with assets valued at between $30-40bn (£24-32bn), giving the palace largely untaxed annual income of around $300m. And he commands his own personal regiment of the Royal Guard, comprising an estimated 5,000 troops.\\nOne advantage he will not have is the immense prestige and respect built by his father over 70 years on the throne, which Thai royal experts point out must be earned, not inherited.\\nVajiralongkorn, at the age of 66, will not have so long to make his mark on the monarchy. But he has had decades to observe and learn from the complex flow of power that surrounds the monarch.\\nHe presided over the elaborate and prolonged funeral rituals for the late king, giving him a chance to enhance his own standing in the process.\\nHe may well be able to rely on the lasting reverence for his father to shore up the monarchy\\'s central role in Thai society.',\n",

       "  'Thailand’s king seeks to bring back absolute monarchy\\nMaha Vajiralongkorn has provoked something new in Thailand: open criticism of a king\\nTHE MONUMENTS disappear in the dark. In April 2017 it was a small bronze plaque from Bangkok’s Royal Plaza.\\nIt marked the spot where, in 1932, revolutionaries proclaimed the end of Thailand’s absolute monarchy.\\nIn December 2018 a statue was hauled away. It commemorated the defeat of rebels who attempted a coup against those same revolutionaries.\\nLast month activists installed a plaque in the heart of Bangkok’s royal district to protest against the missing monuments.\\n“The people have expressed the intention that this country belongs to the people, and not the king”, it stated.\\nThe world knows Thailand’s King Maha Vajiralongkorn as a playboy who has churned through four wives, lives among lots of women in a German hotel and relishes skimpy crop tops that reveal elaborate temporary tattoos.\\nFor Thais, his four-year-old reign has been more sinister.\\nThe king makes elderly advisers crawl before him, shaves the heads of courtiers who displease him and has disowned several of his children.\\nWorse, he has steadily amassed power, taking personal control of “crown property”, assuming direct command of troops and ordering changes to the constitution.\\nHe makes no secret of his hankering for the days of absolute monarchy (hence the disappearing monuments).\\nBut Thais began to protest in July. Can they prevent the removal not just of plaques, but of constitutional constraints?\\nOn October 14th thousands of protesters marched through central Bangkok to camp outside Government House, where ministers’ offices are located.\\nThey also formed human chains to carry away potted plants that blocked the way to the country’s Democracy Monument.\\nNot far away King Vajiralongkorn himself, in the country on a fleeting visit, passed by in a motorcade.\\nClusters of royalists gathered wearing yellow shirts to show their loyalty to him.\\nThat night a spooked government issued an emergency decree banning gatherings of more than four people and prohibiting reporting on topics that could “harm national security” or “cause panic”.\\nThe government warned that protesters who insulted the monarchy would be prosecuted. Several prominent leaders of the protest were arrested the following morning.\\nYet tensions increased as protests continued in defiance of the decree.\\nThailand defines itself as a democracy with the king as head of state. The monarchy is revered. Photographs of royals adorn public buildings and private homes.\\nFather’s Day is celebrated on the previous king’s birthday. Thais hear a royal anthem before films start at the cinema.\\nTechnically King Vajiralongkorn rules as a constitutional monarch. But ancient structures have never entirely disappeared.\\nThe king used to sit at the apex of society in a semidivine role. Defenders of the vestiges of this order have long clashed with those claiming to represent an alternative source of authority: the Thai people.\\nThe conflict helps explain why Thailand has endured 12 coups and 20 constitutions since 1932. Since the 1950s a symbiotic relationship between the army and the palace has bolstered the legitimacy of military regimes.\\nFor the past two decades the greatest foe of such elites has been Thaksin Shinawatra, a populist prime minister ousted by the army in 2006.\\nHis supporters, known as red shirts, battled their yellow-shirted foes in the streets on several occasions in the years after he lost power.\\nThe generals engineered a coup in 2014. The commander who led it, Prayuth Chan-ocha, remains prime minister.\\nAn army-friendly constitution disadvantaged large parties, such as Mr Thaksin’s flagship one, Pheu Thai, in an election last year.\\nOne supposed reason why the army seized power six years ago was to ensure a steady succession between the ninth and tenth monarchs of the Chakri dynasty.\\nKing Vajiralongkorn’s path to the throne was not simple. Thailand’s elites took against him while his popular father still lived.\\nKing Bhumibol Adulyadej was considered the richest monarch in the world, his wealth outstripping that of oil-endowed Middle Eastern rulers and Europe’s royals with their castles and palaces.\\nAristocratic types fretted because the crown prince, as Vajiralongkorn was previously known, caused so many scandals.\\nEven his mother likened him to Don Juan. After leaving his first wife, a princess in her own right, he disowned four of his five children with his second wife, an actress, who eventually fled Thailand.\\nWhen the relationship ended with his third wife—once filmed almost naked and crouching before her husband with birthday cake—several of her family members went to prison.\\nThe prince spent lavishly and indulged in eccentricity, elevating his beloved poodle, Foo Foo, to the rank of “air chief marshal”.\\nStill, King Vajiralongkorn took over unimpeded after his father’s death. Whereas the father was publicly loved, the son is privately loathed.\\nHis coronation last year attracted tiny crowds compared with those at the late king’s funeral rites. Despite his co-operation with army regimes, millions of Thais felt King Bhumibol displayed the virtues expected of a Buddhist monarch.\\nKing Vajiralongkorn does not even live in Thailand. He rules a country of 70m people from more than 5,000 miles away in Germany.\\nOne insider bluntly appraises his activities there: “Bike, fuck, eat. He does only those three things.”\\nThe German government finds his presence awkward. “We have made it clear that politics concerning Thailand should not be conducted from German soil,” the foreign minister, Heiko Maas, told the Bundestag on October 7th.\\nThe king’s militaristic harem inspires embarrassing headlines around the world. Just months after his fourth marriage to a former air stewardess last year, he elevated one concubine, a former nurse, to the status of “royal noble consort”.\\nShe is the first woman to hold this title since Thailand became a constitutional monarchy.\\nSineenat Wongvajirapakdi fell from grace soon after her elevation. She disappeared from view. Then, in September, she was reinstated and declared “untainted”.\\nChinese netizens have likened Ms Sineenat to a crafty concubine from a popular television series, “Empresses in the Palace”.\\nIn March 2012 permission from the Justice Department was published in the Royal Gazette for a temporary prison.\\nA spartan map appears to show its location as possibly within the grounds of a palace owned by Vajiralongkorn.\\nHis bad books are a miserable place to be. Pictures allegedly of Srirasmi Suwadee, once his third wife, appeared in a German newspaper last year.\\nHead shaved and tearful, she was reported as being under house arrest.\\nAiring such dirty linen in public in Thailand, however, is perilous. The country’s lèse-majesté law allows between three and 15 years in prison for insulting “the King, the Queen, the Heir-apparent or the Regent”.\\nKing Vajiralongkorn has instructed the government not to use the law. But this hardly reflects newfound tolerance.\\nCritics instead risk charges for sedition or computer crime, among others. In July one man was sent to a psychiatric hospital for wearing a T-shirt that stated: “I have lost all faith in the institution of monarchy”.\\nPlayboy antics distract from the more sinister feats of the monarch since he came to power. In political, financial and military matters King Vajiralongkorn has gained powers never possessed by his father.\\nHis interventions appear part of a larger strategy to push Thailand closer to absolute monarchy once more.\\nTake his finances. In 2017 he gained full control of the Crown Property Bureau (CPB), which manages royal investments (it was previously run by the ministry of finance).\\nIts holdings are estimated to be worth $40bn. In 2018 the CPB declared that its assets would be considered the king’s personal property.\\nAs a result the monarch has stakes in some of Thailand’s corporate titans. He is the largest shareholder in Siam Cement Group, a conglomerate with revenues of almost $14bn in 2019, with a third of its shares.\\nThe head of the CPB, long a stalwart in the king’s circles, is a director of Siam Cement Group and of the 113-year-old Siam Commercial Bank, one of Thailand’s biggest, in which the king also has a stake.\\nIn addition to the king’s private means, the Thai state showers the royal family with funds. For the 2021 fiscal year government agencies have drawn up budgets which allocate more than 37bn baht—over $1.1bn—to the monarchy.\\nThe Royal Office will receive 9bn baht of that directly. Much of the rest goes to government agencies, the police and the defence ministry for security and for development projects.\\nBy comparison, Britain’s Queen Elizabeth cost her taxpayers the equivalent of $87m last year. Precise details on where the money goes are elusive.\\nHuge sums go to pay for royal transport alone (there are many planes and helicopters to maintain).\\nKing Vajiralongkorn’s political interventions are another demonstration of his growing authority. In theory the monarch sits above parties, parliament and politics.\\nBut after a referendum in 2016, in which campaigners were banned from opposing the constitution put forward for approval, the monarch demanded changes to the charter.\\nHe altered it specifically to make ruling from afar easier.\\nHe meddled even more audaciously ahead of last year’s parliamentary election. Mr Thaksin persuaded the king’s older sister to run as a putative prime ministerial candidate for a party with links to him.\\nBut the crown in effect came to the rescue of Mr Thaksin’s military foes. The monarch declared his sister’s ambitions “unconstitutional”.\\nHe also stated that royals should stay out of politics—yet the night before the election, he urged Thais to vote for “good people”, which was taken as an endorsement of Mr Prayuth and his allies.\\nThis is just one example of how the palace and the barracks have continued to support each other since King Vajiralongkorn came to the throne.\\nThe king has a deep interest in military matters. Trained in an Australian academy, he holds the titles of admiral, field-marshal and air-marshal.\\nThe queen is a general and Ms Sineenat a major-general. The king has drawn military forces to his direct command.\\nThe Royal Command Guard has been created with some 5,000 soldiers. They are stationed in Bangkok, while other important army units, including an infantry regiment and a cavalry battalion which have facilitated past coups, have been moved out of the city.\\nOverthrowing any government without advance co-ordination with royal troops would prove extremely difficult.\\nWhy has the army permitted such manoeuvres? Defence of the monarchy is one of its central reasons for existing.\\nBoth the powerful army commander who retired in September, and his replacement, are deeply loyal to the king.\\nThey also rose through the ranks of the King’s Guard, in which Vajiralongkorn himself once served. Mr Prayuth and his closest allies, by contrast, emerged from the Queen’s Guard within the Second Infantry Division.\\nThe prime minister can hardly counter the monarch’s power grabs. He depends on the king’s support for a semblance of legitimacy.\\nWhereas the middle and upper classes of many countries contain democratic champions, those of Thailand “have never needed mass support to advance or protect their interests”, explains James Wise, a former Australian ambassador to Thailand, in his book “Thailand: History, Politics and the Rule of Law”.\\nThese conservatives would not stand for an army-linked prime minister rebuffing the royal institution.\\nMr Prayuth is also weak: he wrestles even with his allies in the ruling coalition and lacks personal popularity.\\nThat hinders his ability to tackle the difficulties Thailand faces. Growth was slowing even before the coronavirus pandemic struck (see chart).\\nNow the central bank expects the economy to contract by more than 8% this year—worse than the crash in the Asian financial crisis in 1997.\\nA very few opposition politicians have resisted King Vajiralongkorn’s growing control. In October most MPs from the liberal Future Forward Party, founded in 2018, opposed an executive decree in the lower house of parliament.\\nThe decree, which passed anyway, facilitated the partial transfer of army units and related budgetary allocations to the Royal Command Guard.\\nEven so, it was the first time that lawmakers had ever opposed a legal procedure linked to the monarchy.\\nFuture Forward no longer exists. Its platform in favour of democratic freedoms and army reform, as well as the popularity of its charismatic leader, Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit, made it a threat to the establishment.\\nThe outfit grew from nothing to become the country’s third-largest party in parliament in little more than a year.\\nLegal cases against the institution and its leadership started to mount. In November Mr Thanathorn was stripped of his status as an MP.\\nIn February the party was dissolved by the constitutional court and its executives banned from politics for a decade.\\nThe judges decided that a loan Mr Thanathorn gave the party was an illegal breach of individual-donation limits.\\nFlash mobs mounted protests, though social-distancing measures soon put an end to them. The lull was temporary.\\nSocial media have provided an outlet for audacious criticisms. So widespread was moaning over the traffic jams caused by royal motorcades, for example, that in January the king instructed police not to close entire roads for travelling royals.\\nOther grumbles could not so easily be sorted. In August, after legal threats from the Thai government, Facebook blocked access from Thailand to a 1m-member group criticising the monarchy.\\n“Requests like this are severe, contravene international-human rights law, and have a chilling effect on people’s ability to express themselves,” the firm stated.\\nPopular anger has moved from screens to streets. Since July protesters have gathered to call for the dissolution of the government, reform of the constitution and an end to the harassment of opposition activists.\\nStudents’ demonstrations inspired a wider swathe of Thais to march, too. Their efforts mark an evolution from the feud between red shirts and yellow shirts.\\nThe boldest protesters have called openly for reform of the monarchy. They object to the king’s financial set-up and his consolidation of military power.\\nMr Thanathorn has also called for transparency about how state funds are spent on the monarchy.\\nThe situation grew more serious as the protests swelled in size. The great fear is that the bloody treatment of student protesters in the 1970s will be repeated.\\nIn 1976 police, army and vigilante groups attacked students after they staged a mock hanging in protest against the killing of two pro-democracy activists.\\nA story spread among royalists that the figure hanged resembled Crown Prince Vajiralongkorn. According to official figures, 46 students died and more than 3,000 were arrested.\\nSo far the authorities have arrested a few dozen protest leaders. The government had claimed it wanted to talk to students about their grievances.\\n“Having a peaceful and civil dialogue where we exchange our views is the best approach for moving forward,” said the education minister.\\nHowever, this week the establishment ran out of patience. If the prime minister cannot bring calm he may be replaced.\\nAny drastic intervention is unlikely, however, without the monarch’s foreknowledge.\\nBut King Vajiralongkorn’s clout has come at a price: open criticism of the monarchy. “The ghost is out of the bottle and you won’t get it back again,” reckons one diplomat in Bangkok.\\nThe more brazen the king’s moves towards a more absolute form of rule, the more forceful the criticism.\\n“We are trying to bring the king and monarchy under the constitution,” explains one teenage protester.\\n“We aren’t trying to bring them down.” King Vajiralongkorn’s actions could determine whether Thailand continues to revere royalty, or starts to revile it.\\nEditor\\'s note: this piece has been updated to include the Thai government\\'s announcing a state of emergency\\nThis article appeared in the Briefing section of the print edition under the headline \"Battle royal\"\\nDiscover stories from this section and more in the list of contents',\n",

       "  'In Thailand, the coronavirus pandemic has flared into a moment for social-media-savvy observers to put their liberty at risk and question their national monarchy, a pillar of the country’s ruling system.\\nThe kingdom has strict lèse-majesté laws that prohibit direct criticism or insult to King Maha Vajiralongkorn, punishable by up to 15 years in prison.\\nBut online commentators have made increasing use of the internet’s relative anonymity to speak frankly about the head of state and his extravagant lifestyle – including tabloid tales of a quarantine with a harem of 20 concubines in the German Alps.\\nRomchalee Sombulrattanakul, known better as Yammy, has been living in exile from Thailand since 2014 when she left to escape legal backlash after publicly speaking out against the monarchy.\\nShe is a member of Thai folk band Faiyen and, while Yammy and her band-mates originally fled to Laos, last year they gained political asylum in France after the disappearance and presumed murder of three fellow Thai dissidents in the communist country bordering Thailand.\\nYammy said that over the years there have been plenty of less-than-glowing stories about the king, who is also known by the dynastic title Rama X.\\nThough she believed many Thais did not know “the disastrous truth” of his reign, in large part due to state pressure on domestic media, Yammy said the internet may change the conversation.\\n“In this modern era, there is a social network where people can access news around the world,” she said.\\n“Thai people are no longer in front of the television to follow the news of the lies of the Thai king; they are aware of [his] behaviour [sic].”\\nIn her eyes, the spread of Covid-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, and its toll in the kingdom has only added to that.\\n“By the situation of the coronavirus epidemic, in which Thai people face difficulties, famine, poverty, fear, and [then] when someone spreads the news of the Thai king who lives luxuriously in Germany, without self-control and with a large number of servants that follow, it causes Thai people to start thinking and daring to ask ‘Why is the king here?’.”\\nAndrew MacGregor Marshall, a journalist who has spent much of his career covering Thai politics and its monarchy, has at one point been accused of lèse-majesté himself.\\nHe now lectures at Edinburgh Napier University in Scotland but continues to report on Thailand from abroad.\\n“What Thais say publicly about the king isn’t always what they really mean, but I think it’s gotten worse when they see his behaviour now because it’s gotten so ludicrous,” he told the Globe.\\n“It’s such an extremity of behaviour, people are absolutely sick of it on all levels, and that includes royalists as well.”\\nThe king, who ascended to the throne in 2019 after his father’s death three years earlier, was coronated with a reputation as a wealthy, often-eccentric playboy.\\nHe had by then been married three times and was said to have indulged in such uses of power as appointing his poodle to the military rank of Air Chief Marshal.\\nEarlier this month, journalist Marshall self-published an account of the king’s time in the Grand Hotel Sonnenbichl in Bavaria, Germany, which the monarch rented out for himself and his royal contingent.\\nThe Thai king is familiar with the area as he owns a $12M mansion at the nearby Lake Starnberg.\\nAccording to Marshall’s sources, that included a harem of some 20 official concubines who are “self-isolating” with Vajiralongkorn in the hotel.\\nThe German publication Bild had earlier reported the king had needed special permission from local authorities to stay in the hotel, as others in the area have been closed as a public health measure.\\nAccording to Bild, the king’s wife, Suthida, has been staying at a different luxury hotel over the border in Switzerland.\\nVajiralongkorn is believed to spend much of his time living in Germany, even as he presides as symbolic leader of the Thai people and head of a growing contingent of military units.\\nThe king’s absence has not gone unnoticed at home.\\n“Now, with corona, people are wondering ‘Where’s the king?’” Marshall asked. “The job of a monarch is to be with the people and this is kind of a symbolic thing, you’re with the people and you’re standing with them.\\nBut instead, the king is in the Grand Hotel Sonnenbichl in Bavaria with a harem of 20 women.”\\nThe king also courted controversy by returning home in early April, making use of a flight from Zurich to Bangkok believed to have been kept open for his personal use.\\nAs public health officials advised people to stay home and avoid travel, the king reportedly picked up his wife in Zurich before jetting back to Thailand for Chakri Memorial Day, the date marking the founding of his family’s dynasty.\\nIn a whirlwind trip of less than 24 hours, Vajiralongkorn presided over official ceremonies and royal rituals before flying back to Europe.\\nAnd even though the royal family distributed food aid to Thais struggling to make their livelihood during mandated social distancing, Marshall believed it was merely a publicity stunt for “absentee monarchs”.\\nHe doesn’t live in Thailand but this is a time of crisis, and during a time of crisis it’s perceived as even more inappropriate that he’s not in the countryJames Buchanan, a researcher of Thai politics at City University of Hong Kong\\nJames Buchanan, a researcher of Thai politics at City University of Hong Kong, said the king’s lifestyle outside his home country has created “a lot of problems of legitimacy” that existed long before the ongoing pandemic.\\n“He’s the head of state and doesn’t even reside in the state he’s meant to be head of,” Buchanan said.\\nIn his view, that alone is a “bit of a PR disaster” even without pandemic.\\n“Then this covid crisis comes in and accentuates it further,” he said. “He doesn’t live in Thailand but this is a time of crisis, and during a time of crisis it’s perceived as even more inappropriate that he’s not in the country.”\\nBoth Buchanan and Marshall pointed to a Thai hashtag trending at the end of March that translated to #whydoweneedaking?, which emerged when the circumstances of Vajiralongkorn’s self-isolation in Germany began to circulate in international media.\\nThe hashtag had been tweeted 1.2 million times in 24 hours by March 22, according to data on Twitter.\\nThe flurry prompted Minister of Digital Economy and Society Puttipong Punnakanta to tweet a not-so-subtle warning to Thai citizens – a picture of a handcuffed hand over a keyboard.\\nStill, Buchanan pointed out this kind of criticism has a recent track-record in Thailand.\\n“This is not unprecedented and we’ve seen this kind of thing happening for quite a while,” he said. “For maybe a year or two, steadily building up hashtag after hashtag, becoming quite a bit bolder in the criticism.”\\nThais looking to write or read about the monarchy usually turn to Twitter as their medium of choice, flocking to the platform for its ease of anonymity among users.\\nWhile there are ways they can be traced by law enforcement, Buchanan thought it “at the very least gives a false idea of security” compared to more straight-forward sites like Facebook.\\n“If you look at arrests for people of things like lèse-majesté in the past decade or so, they’re all focused on Facebook,” he said.\\n“Twitter is a bit new to [police], they seem a bit taken by surprise by what’s happened there.”\\nThat’s not to say Twitter is a truly safe space to get around restrictions on speech. That was quickly made clear when a 20-year-old user who wrote under the Thai username “Anonymous” and posted regularly about the monarchy was arrested earlier this year and charged in court under Thailand’s Computer-Related Crime Act.\\nThe arrest sparked its own hashtag calling for the user to be freed and was seen as a grim precedent for online discourse.\\nTo gain some plausible deniability when talking about the king, Twitter users may code their language under layers of in-jokes and references, often to pop culture.\\nBuchanan pointed to tweets referring the king as “Justin” – a comparison to pop star Justin Bieber drawn from side-by-side comparisons of the American singer and an infamous picture of the royal in an undershirt and festooned with fake tattoos – or screenshots of television shows to poke fun while avoiding direct references.\\nStill, the online backlash to the king’s most recent exploits in Germany drew users to tweet openly and questioningly under #whydoweneedaking?.\\n“In a way it’s unprecedented [to have this level of criticism of a Thai monarch], and the differences even on social media now compared to when he first came to the throne, it’s incredible,” Marshall said.\\n“This hashtag had millions of tweets, and everyone was weighing in on it.”\\nEven with more online exposure for a different narrative on the monarchy, dissidents like Yammy are not expecting any major changes overnight – especially while the legal system shuts down public conversation on the subject.\\nIf there’s ever to be a discussion of the role of the monarchy in the country, she thinks it would have to come in an environment of freer politics and speech.\\nAs someone who acknowledged having “long criticised and condemned the king”, she’d begin by abolishing the lèse-majesté code.\\n“If Thai people should start thinking about change seriously, [it] begins with the lifting of the law,” Yammy said.\\n“It’s time for Thai people and politicians to be brave and fight together on the real principles.”',\n",
       "  'The billionaire king of Thailand is running out of friends, at home and abroad.\\nKing Maha Vajiralongkorn, who spends much of his time in Germany, in a hotel in the Bavarian Alps accompanied by a modern-day harem of up to 20 female consorts, has now been warned by Angela Merkel’s government not to conduct state business from German soil.\\nHis residency there, which was revealed at the beginning of the coronavirus crisis when the hotel sought special permission to stay open, has become a flashpoint for unprecedented protests in Thailand against the repressive state and its semi-divine royal family.\\nThe protests have been inflamed by reports of the king’s vast wealth, estimated by London’s Financial Times at between $30bn and $40bn, after sovereign funds were effectively put under his direct control by the leaders of a successful 2014 coup.\\nHe is believed to be the world’s richest king. Accounts of his gilded life at the Grand Hotel Sonnenbichl in Garmish-Partenkirchen, where his retinue of 20 concubines who have all been given the same honorary surname includes his fourth wife, are not helping either his domestic or international image.\\nBeing one of the king’s girlfriends is not without risk, however, as illustrated by the fate of his “official” mistress, Sineenat Wongvajirapakdi, 35, who was named Chao Khun Phra, which means “royal noble consort,” shortly after he married his fourth wife, Queen Suthida.\\nIn October 2019, it was announced that Sineenat had been stripped of the title in a palace statement that called her “ungrateful” for conducting a rivalry with Queen Suthida.\\nShe is believed to have spent ten months in jail, but earlier this year she was restored to her former position, with a statement published in the government’s Royal Gazette saying Sineenat was “untainted” and therefore entitled to the royal noble consort title and all her previous posts within the palace.\\nAs The Daily Beast recently reported, Vajiralongkorn is also alleged to have built up an extraordinary fleet of 38 jets and helicopters for the exclusive use of the Thai royal family.\\nReports of his medieval privilege, not carried by local mainstream media due to strict prohibitions, now trickle back into the country via social media and Facebook.\\nThailand earlier this year sought to get Facebook to remove a group critical of the monarchy that had more than a million members, but failed in the attempt.\\nHis overseas existence has led to him being dubbed “The German” by some protesters.\\nAlthough he flew back to Thailand on Saturday, and is expected to remain there to the end of the month, the king’s de facto residency in Bavaria has now also begun to raise eyebrows in Germany as well, with Merkel’s government explicitly saying last week that the Thai king should stop conducting state business while in Germany.\\nMaria Adebahr, spokeswoman for the German foreign ministry, said that the government had repeatedly stressed to Thailand’s ambassador to Berlin that “foreign affairs of state should not be pursued from German soil,” adding, “We have made our position very clear.”\\nThe issue even made it into the German parliament. Frithjof Schmidt, an MP for the opposition Greens, asked why the German government had for months been allowing the king to engage in domestic politics from Bavaria.\\nHeiko Maas, the foreign minister, replied: “We would always clearly counteract efforts by guests in our country to conduct affairs of state from our country.”\\nSchmidt, along with many Germans, is deeply uncomfortable that their country may effectively be providing a headquarters for a repressive regime: Schmidt cited the example of the king’s role in unilaterally preventing his elder sister, Princess Ubolratana Rajakanya, from running as a candidate in the March 24 election.\\nThe move against the princess was widely seen as further evidence of a skewed race in which the prime minister, and leader of Thailand’s 2014 coup, General Prayut Chan-o-cha, had an unfair advantage, as 250 members of the Senate who help chose the PM were simply selected by the junta.\\nStrict laws preventing direct criticism of the monarch, his household, and even his pets are being openly and widely defied for the first time as part of ongoing student-led protests against the government.\\n“It’s the biggest issue of all in Thailand,” Parit “Penguin” Chiwarak, told the Financial Times. “The royal institution can interfere in politics because they have enough money.\\n“If we don’t say it now, when are we going to say it?”\\nOpponents of the commanding position and privilege of the Thai royal family have been emboldened in recent months as rallies by student protesters against the establishment have seen their numbers swelling.\\nThailand is battling a deep recession brought about by COVID-19 and the collapse of the pivotal tourist trade.',\n",

       "  'A royal bubble bursts: Thailand\\'s king faces trouble on two continents\\nThe scion of one of the world’s most privileged families, he wrapped himself in the trappings of royalty, wealth and a comfortable hideaway thousands of miles from his subjects.\\nFor Thailand\\'s King Maha Vajiralongkorn, the cocoon has come undone with remarkable speed.\\nLast week in Berlin, the German government faced questions in Parliament over the king’s legal status in Bavaria, where he resides.\\nForeign Minister Heiko Maas said that if the king were making decisions affecting Thailand from German soil, “We would quite clearly not stand for that.”\\nThen, visiting Thailand this week to mark the fourth anniversary of his father’s death, the king\\'s family came face to face with pro-democracy protesters agitating for limits on his power.\\nAt one point, demonstrators confronted the queen’s motorcade and hurled insults at her cream-colored Rolls-Royce.\\nIn a country where criticizing the king or his family is punishable by up to 15 years in prison, the dramatic scenes in Bangkok provided the starkest illustration yet of the crisis facing Thailand’s constitutional monarchy and the military-led government that supports it.\\n“The bubble that protected them from reality is bursting, without a doubt, and in a very graphic way,” said Pravit Rojanaphruk, senior staff writer with the Khaosod English news site.\\nSince the skirmish with the motorcade Wednesday, authorities have banned large gatherings, arrested dozens of activists and charged two with violence against the queen, which carries a possible life sentence.\\nThousands defied the ban and rallied at a Bangkok intersection Friday evening until police in riot gear dispersed the crowd with batons and water cannons.\\nAs the months-long protest movement continues, the reverence long demanded of Thailand’s monarchy is breaking down in ways big and small.\\nThais are refusing to stand for the royal anthem in movie theaters, lampooning the king in Facebook groups and openly questioning his immense wealth and spending.\\nThe scrutiny he is now facing in Germany is an added nuisance for a 68-year-old king who has long treated his adopted home as a playground.\\nAs the only son of King Bhumibol Adulyadej, who reigned for 70 years, Vajiralongkorn was destined to inherit the throne.\\nBut since about 2007 he has spent most of his time in Germany, where the tabloid press has followed his exploits with relish.\\nIn the picturesque southern state of Bavaria, Vajiralongkorn, who has been married four times, is said to have purchased a villa near pristine Lake Starnberg in the town of Tutzing in 2016.\\nHe reportedly spends time there and at a four-star Alpine hotel in Garmisch-Partenkirchen that he rents out entirely for his entourage, including what one newspaper described as “hundreds” of servants.\\nThe Sueddeutsche Zeitung in Munich reported this year that the king has “acquired an abiding fondness” for the rugged Bavarian foothills.\\n“He likes to pick strawberries, ride bicycles or visit one of the country inns after his tasters have tested everything first and his bodyguards have found the premises appropriate and safe,” the newspaper wrote.\\nAs crown prince, he was known in Bavaria primarily for his eccentric tastes. He was pictured wearing a tight-fitting crop top over an otherwise bare torso while getting on a ski lift, and covered in temporary tattoos during an excursion to a Munich mall.\\nSince he assumed the throne upon his father’s death in 2016, King Vajiralongkorn’s stay in Germany has become more controversial.\\nHe amended the Thai Constitution to allow himself to rule from abroad without appointing a regent, as past monarchs did during long stints outside Thailand.\\nAfter taking personal ownership of the estimated $70-billion crown fortune, he broke with custom by intervening directly in Thai politics — barring his popular sister from running for office in 2019 elections, the first since a 2014 military coup.\\n“His authority is much greater than past monarchs, and he has exercised it very shamelessly since he ascended the throne,” said Junya Yimprasert, a Thai activist who was charged with insulting the monarchy in 2010 and went into exile in Finland.\\nShe has organized several protests in Germany, including outside the hotel in Garmisch-Partenkirchen in September, when she said members of the king’s entourage tailed demonstrators in a car and took their pictures.\\nWhen they reported the harassment to local police, she said, officers told her this was the king’s “normal practice.”\\nActivists and local media have raised questions about the king’s tax status in Germany, as well as whether the government approved his hotel stay while the rest of Bavaria was closed to tourism during a COVID-19 lockdown in the spring.\\nLast week in the Bundestag, a member of the opposition Greens party asked Maas, the foreign minister, whether the government approved of the king making policy decisions about Thailand from Germany.\\n“Why has the German government been tolerating for many months this extremely unusual and, in my view, illegal behavior in Germany by a foreign head of state?” asked the lawmaker, Frithjof Schmidt.\\nMaas responded that he was “aware of the many bizarre reports about what is happening there” but that the government’s position was firm.\\n“We have made it clear that policies concerning Thailand should not be conducted on German soil,” he said.\\nIn an interview, a Greens member of Parliament in Bavaria, Tim Pargent, said the party’s inquiries have established that the king was not in Germany as a diplomat, and is therefore bound by German laws and tax codes.\\n“If he likes living in Germany, that’s quite clearly his right,” Pargent said. “But what I want to avoid is [that] a despot who isn’t treating his own people very well gets any kind of special protection here in Germany.\\nIn Thailand, where past democracy movements have been suppressed with bloody force, the government has been reluctant to use such tactics against the largely student-led protests.\\nFor months, Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha said the government would consider calls to amend the constitution but warned that the monarchy must be respected.\\nBut many demonstrators appear to believe that Thailand’s political system cannot be reformed without trimming the sails of the monarchy, which has seen its share of the public budget grow while economic inequalities worsen and the country faces a wrenching COVID-19 slowdown.\\nFrustration bubbled over Wednesday afternoon when the royal limousine — carrying Queen Suthida, the king’s fourth wife and a former flight attendant, and his son from a previous marriage, Prince Dipangkorn — turned onto a road near Government House, the prime minister’s office.\\nPravit, the journalist, said about 200 protesters gathered there had not expected the motorcade to take that route.\\nIn video shot by Khaosod, one protest leader, college student Francis Bunkueanun Paothon, is seen speaking to police through a megaphone when a phalanx of black-clad officers suddenly pushes up against the crowd, clearing the road.\\nThat was when the motorcade appeared. Many demonstrators flashed the three-finger salute that has become a protest trademark; others raised their middle fingers, yelled insults or chanted, “It’s my tax,” referring to the royals’ spending.\\nNone got close to the car, and there was no damage. But on Friday, Bunkueanun stood outside a Bangkok police station and said he had been accused of intent to harm the queen, the most serious charge leveled against protesters since the demonstrations began.\\nFacing the prospect of life in prison, he wiped away tears but vowed to keep fighting “even if I have to risk it all.”\\nMy friends, this is Francis typing. I would like to leave this message to you all before I become the man with no freedom.\\nKeep moving forward, with a strong and active faith.

       "  'The world’s richest king, his mysterious fortune and Thailand’s protesters who want answers\\nThe crown prince of Thailand’s third marriage unraveled in lurid headlines: The princess was stripped of her titles, her parents and brothers jailed over vague corruption allegations, her uncle purged from his senior police post.\\nThen the heir to the throne had to finesse a divorce settlement.\\nLuckily for the prince, he had access to one of the largest royal fortunes in the world, a secretive holding company laden with stakes in blue-chip Thai companies and prime land in the heart of Bangkok.\\nThe company covered the payment, reportedly close to $6 million.\\nTwo years later, in 2016, the prince ascended to the throne. One of King Maha Vajiralongkorn’s first major acts was to transfer all the holdings in the vast company, known as the Crown Property Bureau, to his personal ownership, giving him control of more wealth than the reported riches of the Saudi king, the sultan of Brunei and the British royal family combined.\\nThose assets — conservatively valued at $70 billion — are now a focus of a pro-democracy movement clamoring for greater transparency into the monarchy’s finances and limits on its extensive powers.\\nTens of thousands rallied in Bangkok on Thursday evening, ignoring a government ban on protests and chanting for the release of about 40 activists arrested in the last week.\\nA day earlier, some protesters heckled a motorcade carrying the queen during a rare public appearance in the capital by the ruling couple, who live in Europe.\\nThe mostly peaceful demonstrations began this summer. In August, students at Thammasat University demanded the king restore the assets to Crown Property Bureau control and place it under government oversight — a startling act of defiance in a country where a strict royal insult law has traditionally silenced criticism of the monarchy.\\nSome protesters have also called for a boycott of Siam Commercial Bank, in which the king holds a nearly 24% stake.\\nFears of a run on deposits prompted a director of Thailand’s central bank to reassure investors that there was sufficient liquidity in the country’s financial institutions.\\n“When the protesters talk about the monarchy as an institution, the CPB is at the core,” said Pongkwan Sawasdipakdi, a lecturer at Thammasat and a doctoral candidate in international relations at USC.\\n“One of the top things that people think about is how can the monarchy accumulate such really high wealth and we don’t really know anything about it.”\\nTattep Ruangprapaikitseree and other young activists want to rein in the monarchy and its military allies who have ruled Thailand since a 2014 coup.\\nQuestions over spending by an aloof monarch, whose expensive lifestyle stands in contrast to stories of his thrifty father, have emerged as Thailand’s economy reels from the COVID-19 pandemic, which followed years of tepid growth under a military-led government closely tied to the ruling family.\\nOpposition politicians led by lawmaker Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit have also challenged an additional $1 billion in public funds earmarked for the monarchy in the 2020 budget — including security, travel, ceremonies and “special activities” — while the economy is projected to shrink by 8%.\\nTens of thousands of peaceful demonstrators have gathered in rallies since early summer, a remarkable political reawakening in a country that abolished the absolute monarchy in favor of a parliamentary system in 1932 but has steadily drifted away from democratic rule.\\nThe army, with royal support, has toppled a succession of civilian governments and now controls the parliament and nearly every state institution.\\nThe military, in turn, fell in line when the king took over the Crown Property Bureau, whose enormous interests “enter into almost every significant area of Thai economic life,” Porphant Ouyyanont, a late Thai academic who was the leading authority on the bureau, wrote in a 2015 paper.\\nCreated in 1936 to manage the crown’s institutional assets and cover some of its expenses, the bureau operates in a legal netherworld — neither a government agency nor a private institution, nor part of the palace — and in near-total secrecy from inside a butterscotch-yellow Italianate villa in Bangkok’s leafy royal district.\\nIts board of directors, handpicked by the king, doesn’t release financial statements. Much of its holdings, especially in land, remain a mystery.\\nBut the estimated portfolio makes him the world’s richest monarch, a man who owns lakeside villas outside Munich, Germany, and rents out a hotel in the Bavarian Alps.\\nThe bureau’s biggest corporate investments — in Siam Commercial Bank and Siam Cement Group, an industrial conglomerate in which it holds a 34% stake — were together worth about $8 billion at the end of last year, according to the companies’ annual reports.\\nAlthough the bank’s shares have lost half their value during the pandemic, dividends from the two publicly traded companies generated $342 million in income for the king in 2019.\\nIts landholdings — including 5½ square miles spread across high-rent districts of central Bangkok — were estimated by Porphant to be worth $32 billion in 2015, but little is leased for commercial use.\\nScrutiny of these assets was long seen as unnecessary because the monarchy and its holdings had “proved themselves to be of no financial burden to the country,” Porphant wrote.\\nThe current ruler’s father, King Bhumibol Adulyadej, who reigned for 70 years, was portrayed in royalist propaganda as so frugal that he never wasted a dab of toothpaste — even as Thailand grew into an economic engine of Southeast Asia and the crown’s investments multiplied in value.\\nEducated at boarding school in Britain and a military academy in Australia, the 68-year-old monarch is married to his fourth wife and spends almost all his time in Germany, often in the company of a girlfriend known as the “royal consort” and a retinue of attendants and security.\\nEven from that distance he has taken a more assertive role in Thai politics, brought two military units under his command and changed the law to allow himself to reign from abroad.\\nIn July 2017, nine months after he assumed the throne, a law passed by the military-dominated parliament placed the Crown Property Bureau’s assets “under His Majesty’s discretion,” ending the previous arrangement under which the monarch could spend the bureau’s income at will but left buying and selling decisions to the board of directors.\\nThe king removed the finance minister and the bureau’s long-standing director-general from the board and installed his private secretary, a 69-year-old with no finance or economics background, as chairman and several other loyalists as members.\\n“The assumption must be that the monarch is now the principal decision-maker,” said Tom Felix Joehnk, a Bangkok-based writer and economist.\\nThe assets are now subject to taxes for the first time, but little else about the portfolio has changed.\\nVajiralongkorn has retained the corporate shareholdings and generally continued its conservative approach to land.\\nThe plots include some of the most sought-after neighborhoods in the capital, along the Chao Phraya River and in the commercial districts of Silom and Sukhumvit.\\nBut Porphant found that 93% of the land generated little to no income, rented at “much lower than market rates” to slum communities, state agencies, schools, foundations and others with special relationships to the crown.\\nThe last category includes the U.S. government, which for decades has rented the ambassador’s residence — a stately, blue-shuttered mansion surrounded by lawns — for just “a few hundred dollars” a month, Joehnk said.\\nCritics say the opaque system allows the king to treat land deals as political favors, at odds with demonstrators’ goal of a modern constitutional monarchy.\\nIn a 2011 interview with author Serhat Unaldi, former director Chirayu Isarangkun na Ayuthaya said the bureau considered “social benefits … not only financial values” when developing land for commercial use.\\nStill, the bureau has sought to extract more money from its land since the 1997 Asian financial crisis temporarily wiped out its income.\\nNewer tenants include Bangkok’s top shopping malls and luxury hotels. In 2017 it signed over several adjoining plots to build Thailand’s biggest private development, a $3.6-billion complex of hotels, condos and a mall on what had been a boxing stadium and night market.\\nIn 2018 the capital’s much loved zoo suddenly announced it was moving from crown-owned land opposite the former king’s residence to a new site in a northern suburb.\\nOther properties in the area have also been retaken by the crown, fueling speculation that Vajiralongkorn might build Bangkok’s first new royal palace in more than a century.\\n“There is a fair amount of land being developed, but it is not clear to me that there is a shift in the investment strategy,” Joehnk said.\\n“The development of royal land for royal purposes [would be] new, though.”\\nThose seeking answers from the bureau, which didn’t respond to an interview request, would be disappointed.\\nIt hasn’t published an annual report since 2016. Parts of its website pull up empty pages; most of the English-language site is “under construction.”\\n“The status of the organization is clear now, whereas it wasn’t so clear before,” said Kevin Hewison, an emeritus professor of Asian studies at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.\\n“It was in a legal nether land and it’s not now. It’s the king’s own personal property. But there’s much less information about it.”',\n",
       "  'Maha Vajiralongkorn: Pilot, Playboy And Thailand’s Non-Resident King\\nNEW DELHI: He has lived life king size, done what he wanted, without fuss. But Maha Vajiralongkorn now faces unprecedented public clamour for monarchical reform that would clip his powers.\\nAny insult to Thai royals is a crime that is punishable by up to 15 years in jail but that has hardly deterred protesters from questioning regal powers.\\nIn Thailand, the king enjoys unbridled authority. No one—government, media or the public—messes with it.\\nBut winds of change, it seems, are now pounding the once-impregnable palace walls.\\nHis official coronation as the 10th king of the Chakri dynasty took place in May last year, though he took the throne after his father King Bhumibol Adulyadej died in 2016.\\nThe transition was smooth but Vajiralongkorn had big boots to fill and a reputation to defend, unlike his father who was hugely popular among the masses and was looked up to as demi god.\\nKing Adulyadej is widely credited with making royalty more relevant in a military-dominated political system, to give Thailand a more meaningful constitutional monarchy.\\nDuring his 70-year reign, he remained a pillar of stability amid political turbulence. Charitable ventures initiated and bankrolled by him, especially in rural Thailand, made him a loved and revered public figure.\\nKing Vajiralongkorn comes nowhere close to getting that adulation. Marriages, divorces and playboy tendencies have dominated coverage of him in the international media.\\nDays before he was crowned, Vajiralongkorn announced his fourth marriage, with Suthida Tidjai—a former flight attendant with Thai Airways.\\nThe king’s first marriage, in 1977, lasted 16 years. He had a mistress though, actress Yuvadhida Polpraserth, with whom he fathered five children before he finally married her in 1994 after divorcing his first wife.\\nThe second marriage was short-lived. They split two years later. Vajiralongkorn wed for the third time in 2001, to Srirasmi Suwadee, a lady-in-waiting.\\nThey divorced in 2014 after many of her relatives were arrested on corruption charges.\\nThis aspect of Vajiralongkorn’s personality was understood by none better than his mother Queen Sirikit, who made it known during her visit to America in 1981.\\n“I have to be very frank. My son, the crown prince, is a little bit of a Don Juan,” she told the Dallas Times Herald.\\n“He is a good student, a good boy, but women find him interesting and he finds women even more interesting.\\nAnother practice of Vajiralongkorn sticks out like a sore thumb. He spends most of his time in Germany, making fleeting visits to Thailand.\\nHe owns a large villa in the German town of Tutzing, on Lake Starnberg, 40 km from Munich. Last week, the German government conveyed its displeasure about the king ruling from German soil to Thai authorities.\\nAnother grouse against him is that he arrogated public property to himself, by getting a law passed to give the king full control of the Crown Property Bureau that was earlier under government control.\\nRoyal properties are estimated to be worth $40 billion.\\nIf the military-backed government has been loyal to His Majesty, Vajiralongkorn has paid back in kind.\\nIn 2019, as his elder sister Princess Ubolratana announced that she would run for prime minister (as an opposition party candidate), Vajiralongkorn called her candidacy inappropriate and unconstitutional.\\nEarlier this year, the king reinstated Sineenat Wongvajirapakdi as the royal consort, nearly a year after she was stripped of all her titles for what was called misbehavior and disloyalty towards the monarch.\\nThe 35-year-old, a former nurse, had been in a relationship with Vajiralongkorn when he was crown prince.\\nLater, she joined the royal guard and was made a major general. She was made the consort just months after Vajiralongkorn married for the fourth time.\\nVajiralongkorn has schooled in the UK and Australia before joining the Royal Military College at Duntroon, Canberra.\\nHe is a fighter pilot and has served as an officer in the Royal Thai Army. But all that pales before his vast experience of being a playboy and a husband at the same time.',\n",
       "  'Thai Pro-Democracy Protesters Ask Germany to Investigate King\\nThousands of pro-democracy protesters marched to the German embassy in Bangkok on Monday to ask for an investigation into whether Thailand’s monarch has been conducting his kingdom’s affairs from Bavaria, as the Thai parliament opened a two-day special session to debate their demands.\\nKing Maha Vajiralongkorn (Rama X) has spent much of his time in the southern German state after he succeeded his late father on the throne four years ago, according to reports.\\nSince mid-July, massive student-led protests in Thailand have called for the resignation of Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-o-cha, the former army chief who led a military coup in 2014, as well as reforms and constitutional amendments to curb the monarchy’s power.\\nLate Monday afternoon, pro-democracy protesters gathered at Bangkok’s Sam Yan Intersection, from where they walked 4.1 km (2.5 miles) to the German embassy.\\nThere, they presented a letter to Ambassador Georg Schmidt.\\nThe “open letter from the citizens of Thailand” asked the German government to investigate their concerns about Vajiralongkorn.\\nAmong the demands listed in their letter, the protesters said “we request the German government to conduct an investigation and disclose King Maha Vajiralongkorn’s entry and departure records, in order to determine whether His Majesty has exercised the sovereignty on German soil.”\\nAfter handing the letter to Berlin’s envoy, Patsaravalee Tanakitvibulpon, one of three protester leaders who met Schmidt, said the ambassador told them that “he sincerely listened to our voices.”\\n“We highly hope that Germany would give the answers to the Thai citizens,” she told the crowd of demonstrators.\\nEarlier in the day, a group of royalists who called themselves the “Thai Citizens,” gathered at the German embassy to submit their own letter regarding the bilateral relationship.\\n“Thai people are concerned that certain groups of protesters are dragging Germany into conflict with Thailand to benefit their course of political struggle,” the letter said.\\nThe German parliament previously addressed this issue when Foreign Minister Heiko Maas answered a question about Vajiralongkorn’s role in Thai politics.\\n“We have made it clear that politics concerning Thailand should not be conducted from German soil. If there are guests in our country that conduct their state business from our soil we would always want to act to counteract that,” Maas said, according to Reuters news service on Oct. 8.\\nOn the eve of Monday’s demonstrations in front of the German diplomatic mission here, the embassy sent a note verbale to the Thai Ministry of Foreign Affairs to draw its attention to the planned pro-democracy protest.\\n“The Embassy of the Federal Republic of Germany recognizes the rights of peaceful assembly of the citizens of the Kingdom of Thailand, including in proximity to the embassy,” a copy of the note said.\\n“As in previous instances, the embassy is ready to receive messages addressed to the federal government conveyed in a peaceful manner,” it went on to say.\\nMonday’s letter presentation by the young activists occurred four days after Prayuth, on Oct. 22, lifted an emergency decree for Bangkok that limited political demonstrations to four people.\\n“Currently, the severe situation which resulted in the emergency decree has subsided and violence has ended, therefore government officials and state agencies can enforce regular laws,” the announcement in the Royal Gazette said on Thursday.\\nPrayuth issued the decree on Oct. 15, one day after thousands of yellow shirt pro-monarchy demonstrators lined the streets of a pro-democracy rally that started at Democracy Monument and moved over to Government House, where the prime minister and other government officials have offices.\\nIn an unexpected confrontation, a group of protesters briefly stranded a limousine carrying Queen Suthida and her stepson, gesturing at them with a three-fingered salute, while pro-royalists who gathered in the same area chanted “long live the Queen,” according to a video clip broadcast on Nation TV.\\nWhile the pro-democracy group began their protests on July 18, this was the first with a counter-protester presence.\\nOn Oct. 16, riot police fired water cannons mixed with a chemical dye that can irritate the skin at pro-democracy protesters who had gathered at the Siam Square business district.\\nPolice also arrested Ekachai Hongkangwan and Bunkueanun Paothong, who were seen in a video of the incident with the queen’s car and were charged with harassing her, a charge that could carry a sentence of life in prison.\\nThe yellow shirts held their own demonstration on Oct. 23, paying homage to the late King Chulalongkorn, the current king’s great-grandfather.\\nVajiralongkorn and Queen Suthida greeted the partisan crowd at the Royal Plaza in front of his Dusit palace.\\n“Excellent, very brave, thank you,” the king was seen saying to Thitiwat Tanagaroon and patting his shoulder, according to a video clip that Thitiwat posted on his Facebook page.\\nThitiwat had held a portrait of the royal couple above his head while standing amid pro-democracy protesters at an earlier rally.\\n“I almost fainted, the majesties remembered me,” Thitiwat said in his post.\\nIn opening the special two-day session of parliament on Monday, Prayuth told MPs that he could not afford to let a “chaotic change” happen in the country.\\nThe prime minister had dismissed the protesters’ demand that he resign from office over the weekend.\\n“I, in the name of the government and prime minister, realize that all things change with the world as time goes by, but there are tens of millions of Thais who don’t want to see the change in a chaotic manner,” Prayuth said.\\n“All have their own beliefs and experiences. We need to find a ‘constructive balance’ of each of their personal desires and those of others.”\\nSen. Paiboon Nitiwan spoke out about the pro-democracy demonstrators’ confrontation with the queen.\\n“Their demand for monarchal reform is to belittle the monarchy in an effort to establish a republic instead,” he told the parliament.',\n",
       "  'First day on duty for Thailand’s untested new king\\nBANGKOK -- Thailand’s new king on Friday carried out his first official duty, attending a solemn religious ceremony to honor his father and predecessor who died seven weeks ago.\\nKing Maha Vajiralongkorn Bodindradebayavarangkun attended the Buddhist ceremony for the late King Bhumibol Adulyadej the morning after he was formally named the kingdom’s new monarch, the tenth in the 234-year-old Chakri dynasty.\\nThailand has been in a state of national mourning since Bhumibol’s Oct. 13 death at age 88 after years of ill health, and public reaction to the installation of a new king has been muted.\\nFriday’s merit-making ceremony at Bangkok’s Grand Palace was one of many held around the nation to mark the 50th day since Bhumibol’s passing.\\nVajiralongkorn, 64, faces the challenges of helping heal a nation fractured by a decade of sometimes violent political strife, and living up to his father’s reputation as a righteous, hardworking monarch dedicated to his country’s development.\\nThe new king, with less intense interest in administration and a reputation as a playboy, does not command the same level of respect as Bhumibol.\\nHe has gone through divorces with three women who have borne him seven children, and in recent years has spent much of his time residing in Germany.\\nAlthough most Thais are devoted to the royal institution, it is hard to gauge how they feel privately about Vajiralongkorn because of harsh laws that mandate a prison term of three to 15 years for anyone found guilty of insulting the monarchy.\\nBut several spoke in street interviews about their optimism.\\n“No matter who the king is, I hope that he will unite Thai hearts,” said Saonuttaporn Guachim, a student at Chulalongkorn University.\\n“Thai people love and respect the monarchy, and, for us, this is a new beginning,” said office worker Kharon Neungpirom.\\n“We will love and respect (the king) as we always have.”\\nThe new king’s older sister, Princess Ubolratana Rajakanya, and former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra were among those who posted congratulatory messages on their Instagram accounts, but there was much less commentary on social media on Vajiralongkorn’s ascension than there was when Bhumibol died.\\nA statement issued by U.S. Ambassador to Thailand Glyn Davies offered best wishes “for an auspicious and prosperous reign.”\\n“As with His Majesty’s late father, the beloved King Bhumibol Adulyadej, under His Majesty King Maha Vajiralongkorn Bodindradebayavarangkun we will continue to commit ourselves to deepen and strengthen the bonds between us, and foster ever-greater stability and prosperity for both our peoples,” he said.'])"

       "[Document(page_content='In recent months, a national writer for Mother Jones magazine named Stephanie Mencimer has been digging into a story about the local roots of FloridaMan and U.S. Congressman Matt Gaetz.\\nIt finally dropped last week. And it should be mandatory reading for residents of the Panhandle who need to understand just how badly our community has been conned by small and corrupt confederacy political players who created Matt Gaetz.\\nHere are just a few highlights from Mencimer’s work:\\n► While Matt rants against boogeymen like \"socialism\" and \"leftist\" healthcare hijackers, the Gaetz family money came from a hospice company called \"Vitas\" that profited from Medicare and Medicaid payments.\\nThe company made the Gaetz family rich when they sold it. And later, it was sued by the Justice Department for allegedly defrauding Medicare, as Mencimer explains:\\n“In 2004, Don Gaetz and his partners cashed in, selling the hospice company to the parent company of the plumbing behemoth Roto-Rooter for $400 million.\\nWhen he ran for state Senate two years later, Don had a net worth of $25 million. In 2013, the Justice Department sued Vitas, alleging that between 2002 and 2013, the company had defrauded Medicare by filing false claims for services never provided or for patients who weren’t terminally ill.\\nThe company settled the case in 2017 for more than $75 million, at the time the largest settlement ever recovered from a hospice company.”\\nMencimer noted that Don Gaetz wasn’t named in the case and has denied any wrongdoing. But the fact is our so-called \"conservative\" congressman\\'s family made millions on the backs of taxpayers.\\nThe \"free market\" is fantastic when the public provides your payday.\\n► With links to a disgraced former Florida House Speaker, the branches of the Panhandle political tree are as crooked as they come.\\nFor a congressman who rails against corruption and preaches political purity, Gaetz\\'s hometown political roots are downright dirty.\\n“Less than a year after his drunk-driving arrest, he declared his candidacy for the state House seat in Florida’s 4th District, which was about to be vacated by House Speaker Ray Sansom, a friend of Don Gaetz for whom Matt had worked as a legislative aide during law school.\\nIn April 2009, Sansom was indicted on corruption charges, accused of tweaking the state budget to funnel more than $25 million to Northwest Florida State College in Niceville.\\nOf those funds, $6 million was earmarked to build a hangar at the Destin airport for a jet company owned by one of Sansom’s friends and donors, real estate developer Jay Odom.\\nOdom was also a client of Matt Gaetz, who handled Odom’s hangar lease. (In 2013, Odom would be sentenced to six months in prison for illegally funneling $23,000 into former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee’s failed 2008 presidential campaign.\\nIn the past decade, Odom has contributed thousands of dollars to Gaetz’s political campaigns. Odom did not respond to an interview request.)\"\\nJoe Scarborough got a mention along with Jeb Bush for being campaign contributors to the Gaetzes. And Lewis Bear is mentioned only as “a Pensacola beer baron,” which conjures images of Snoopy doing aerial combat if there was a Budweiser logo on the side of his red dog house.\\nThe point is that Matt isn\\'t self-made. He was manufactured by an unimpressive network of Huckabees and Sansoms and Odoms and \"beer barons\" and Fish House fundraisers who would all be non-influential nobodies in any other part of the state.\\nBut in the small pond of the Panhandle, a few fat fish have foisted a phony congressman on the rest of us.\\n► The boy who cries “fake news” may have lied to his father about visiting wounded veterans in Walter Reed Hospital, because regrettably, his father mislead readers of this newspaper about it.\\nIn a 2017 column about charitable Christmas giving, Don Gaetz wrote, “Matt goes to Walter Reed Hospital in Washington, D.C. every week to visit warfighters from our area who are fighting the battle after the battle.\\nTheir struggle now is to reclaim their health, their mobility and their lives. Matt says we can never do enough for them and their families.\\nHe chokes up, a rare thing for him, when we donate in his name to support veterans’ housing, rehabilitative care, jobs.”\\nIt was an emotional and heart-wrenching image. A congressman so personally moved by the price paid by wounded warriors that he visited them on a weekly basis.\\nMencimer fact-checked the claim and found out this: “In reality, Matt Gaetz has made only two visits to wounded vets at Walter Reed since taking office, the last one in September 2017.\\nKeep that little tidbit in mind the next time you hear from the boy who cries “fake news.” You might not be a fan of this newspaper.\\nBut I’ve never heard of a reporter or an idiot cartoonist lying to the public about weekly visits to wounded veterans.\\n► Mencimer detailed a shady scheme to funnel family money to Matt once Jeff Miller announced his retirement in 2016.\\n“In just six years, his net worth had dwindled from nearly $1 million to $388,000, according to his financial disclosures.\\nMost of that was tied up in property he owned. He had less than $90,000 in liquid assets.\\n“Yet less than three weeks after Miller announced his retirement, Gaetz dumped $100,000 into his own campaign.\\nFour months later, he gave another $100,000... It would have been illegal for Don Gaetz to lend six figures to the campaign, but he appears to have found another way to funnel money to his son’s race.”\\n“Public records and financial disclosure forms show that in the days following Miller’s retirement announcement, Matt Gaetz sold a house he owned for just under $100,000.\\nThree months later, he sold several vacant lots he’d bought years earlier. All of Gaetz’s real estate was purchased by the same buyer: a company called Treveron, which, it turns out, is owned by his dad.”\\nMencimer said the transactions fall into a “gray area” of campaign finance law. So they weren’t necessarily illegal.\\nBut for a conman who pushes the myth and morals of a hard work ethic and personal responsibility, it’s just more evidence of the grand illusion that has duped so many suckers in Northwest Florida into buying the Gaetz bag of buffalo chips.\\nMencimer even wrote about the 37-year-old\\'s effort to conceal details about his love life that contradict his self-righteous claims of moral authority and true-conservatism.\\n“Two years ago, a former staffer sent him a blunt text message about a 21-year-old woman Gaetz was dating, who would later become a Democratic congressional intern, urging him to ask the woman to delete photos of him from her Instagram account.\\nThe staffer wrote, “Don’t be surprised if many of the conservatives and competitors, like Cris Dosev in Florida CD1, may frown upon her sexually explicit images, her videos showcasing her multiple capabilities to smoke weed, and her flagrant application of language as antithetical to the values of Northwest Florida.”\\nIt’s fitting that Matt has become one of the biggest pushers of marijuana policies in Florida. The Panhandle has been dazed and hazed by the phony persona of a family-financed self-promoter who in reality, has almost nothing in common with the vast majority of working class folks and families here in the Florida Panhandle.\\nMaybe Gaetz is just a sign of the times, an organism of the ecosystem, and a perfectly predictable politician for our phony modern era of Kardashian selfies, Facebook “memories”, self-staring smartphones and patriotism emblazoned on red hats made in China.\\nOf course it’s all a cheap and corny sham. Many things are these days.\\nAnd maybe we just can\\'t tell the difference anymore.\\nOr maybe with reporting like this from Mencimer and Mother Jones, we don’t really have any excuse for not knowing better.\\nRead the full story at: https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2019/07/how-matt-gaetz-used-daddys-money-to-become-trumps-favorite-congressman/'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Largest US hospice company sued for Medicare fraud\\nA lawsuit filed by the U.S. Department of Justice asserts that Vitas Hospice Services, a company founded in 1983 by a group that included state Senate President Don Gaetz, submitted fraudulent bills for Medicare payment.\\nThe lawsuit alleges that for 12 years Vitas “violated the False Claims Act and misspent tens of millions of taxpayer dollars” by billing Medicare “for ineligible patients and inflated levels of care,” a Department of Justice news release said.\\nGaetz said Thursday that he has not been contacted about the complaint and was not a party to it.\\n“I have no direct knowledge of the complaint that’s been made, but it is heartbreaking to see a company I helped found involved in something like this,” he said.\\nVitas is the largest hospice care chain in the country.\\nThe Justice Department claims the Medicare fraud was occurring in 2001, three years before Gaetz and his partners sold the company.\\nBut Gaetz said he remained active in the management of Vitas only until 2000. He stepped aside that year when he was elected superintendent of the Okaloosa County School District.\\n“I told my partners I was interested in becoming superintendent of schools, and when I got elected I said I was stepping back,” said Gaetz, who lives in Niceville.\\n“I gave up all management responsibilities in 2000, though I continued as a shareholder and attended about four board meetings a year.”\\nIn 2004, Gaetz and fellow Vitas founders Hugh Westbrook and Esther Colliflower sold their stock in the company to Cincinnati-based Chemed for $406 million.\\nThe Justice Department alleges Vitas Hospice and Vitas Healthcare submitted claims for unneeded emergency services for patients or services that weren’t provided, the Associated Press has reported.\\nThe companies pressured their employees to submit more claims to get more revenue, the AP said.\\nGaetz said he is not clear on the merits of the case against Vitas Hospice Services LLC, Vitas Healthcare Corp. and Chemed.\\n“My understanding is that the owners and operators of the company are aggressively denying the complaint,” he said.\\nGaetz said he recognizes that different management priorities can evolve when a conglomerate takes over a company from its founders.\\n“I would say there are people who are still caring employees of Vitas that were there when I was involved,” he said.\\n“They are good people that I feel bad for, having to defend against this complaint.”\\nAn Associated Press version of this story is posted below:\\nFORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) — The Department of Justice is suing the hospice company founded by Florida\\'s Senate president, accusing it of submitting tens of millions of dollars in fraudulent Medicare claims for more than a decade, including while Don Gaetz was vice chairman of the board.\\nVitas Hospice and Vitas Healthcare submitted claims for emergency services for patients that weren\\'t needed, weren\\'t provided, or were provided to patients who weren\\'t eligible under Medicare requirements, according to the DOJ.\\nThe companies set goals for the number of crisis-care days to be billed and pressured their employees to submit more claims so it would get more revenue, the lawsuit said.\\nThe agency said Medicare payments for crisis care can be hundreds of dollars greater than typical hospice care payments.\\nVitas is the largest U.S. hospice care chain, and its parent company Chemed Corp. said the claims go back to 2002, two years before it acquired the company.\\nGaetz told The Associated Press on Thursday that he has not been involved with the management of the company for about 13 years, saying he gave up a management role in 2000 when he became Okaloosa County\\'s school superintendent.\\nHe founded the company in the early 1980s with Rev. Hugh Westbrook, a Democratic activist, and Esther Colliflower, a nurse.\\nStarting with an $1,800 investment, they turned Vitas into the largest company of its kind before selling it for millions to Chemed in 2004.\\nThat\\'s made Gaetz, R-Niceville, one of the Legislature\\'s wealthiest members with a net worth of about $25 million.\\n\"I continued to be a shareholder and member of the board of directors until the company was sold in 2004,\" he said, adding that he doesn\\'t currently \"own a single share of stock and I have no role with the company in any capacity.\"\\nGaetz was vice chairman of the board during part of the time that federal investigators allege the fraud took place, but he said he had no \"role in the operation of the company\" when he served as vice-chair.\\n\"It\\'s heartbreaking to see an organization which I remember as one of the formative change agents in end-of-life care in this country having to deal with a complaint like this but it\\'s not something that I have any knowledge of or any connection with,\" he said.\\nChemed said in a statement that it will fight the lawsuit \"vigorously.\"\\nThe lawsuit was filed Thursday, the night before the Florida session ended. The next day, shares of Chemed lost $14.27, or 17.5 percent of their value, to $67.52 in afternoon trading.\\nThe Justice Department says Medicare reimburses hospice care for patients who are suffering from a terminal illness and who are expected to live six months or less if the disease progresses at its normal rate.\\nPatients receiving hospice care are treated for pain and stress and symptoms but don\\'t receive treatment for their illnesses.\\nThose patients can get \"crisis care\" if they need immediate, short-term care from nurses or else hospitalization will be required.\\nThe department says the crisis care rate is the highest daily rate a hospice can bill Medicare.\\n\"The government contends that Chemed and Vitas violated the False Claims Act and misspent tens of millions of taxpayer dollars from the Medicare program,\" the Justice Department said in a news release.\\nCincinnati-based Chemed said the government can seek statutory penalties, costs, and triple damages.

       " Document(page_content='Social media posts distort the facts around an 11-year-old, dismissed DUI charge against Rep. Matt Gaetz.\\nThey also leave the false impression that he “stole from dying people.”\\nPosts about Rep. Matt Gaetz circulating on social media in recent days bend the facts to argue that the Florida Republican is part of the so-called “swamp.”\\n“Republican Matt Gaetz has had numerous DUIs and his dad got him off each time,” read the Facebook posts, accompanied by a mugshot of Gaetz.\\n“He was part of a company that had to pay 75 million in hospice fraud. They stole from dying people. He is the swamp.”\\nLike many claims that gain traction on social media, the posts have some factual basis but are muddied by misrepresentation, exaggeration and speculation.\\nCourt records and press reports show that Gaetz was arrested once, in 2008, on charges that he was driving while intoxicated — but the case was later dismissed, the Okaloosa County court docket shows.\\nThe posts offer no evidence that Gaetz has “had numerous DUIs,” or that his father, Don, a Florida state senator from 2006 to 2016, “got him off each time.”\\nHere’s what we know about the 2008 case: Gaetz, 26 at the time, was arrested in October 2008 while driving home from a nightclub — ironically, called the Swamp — on Florida’s Okaloosa Island, according to the Tampa Bay Times.\\nIn reviewing the matter in 2014, the newspaper wrote:\\nTampa Bay Times, Feb. 18, 2014: Near midnight, Okaloosa County Deputy Chris Anglin clocked Gaetz going 48 in a 35 mph zone.\\nAnglin later reported that Gaetz fumbled for his license and registration, his eyes were watery and bloodshot, and he swayed and staggered when he got out of the car.\\nSmelling alcohol, Anglin asked Gaetz if he had been drinking. Gaetz replied no. Minutes later, he admitted he had consumed two beers.\\nTwice, Anglin conducted an eye test. Twice, Gaetz’s eyes didn’t follow the prompt.\\nGaetz, who had recently begun practicing law, declined any field sobriety tests. He was arrested and refused the breath test.\\nWeeks after the arrest, Anglin, the officer who arrested Gaetz, reportedly resigned amid several alleged infractions, including that he used excessive force against another DUI suspect soon after Gaetz’s arrest.\\nAfter Anglin quit, “the prosecutor asked to be taken off the case, because his stepson was friends with Gaetz.\\nThen-Gov. Charlie Crist’s office assigned the case to Steve Meadows, the state attorney for the neighboring circuit,” according to the Tampa Bay Times.\\nGaetz’s defense attorney, Drew Pinkerton, filed a motion to dismiss the case that December. According to a report at the time from the Northwest Florida Daily News, the defense claimed that Gaetz had answered “no” to the officer’s question about whether he had too much to drink — not to whether he had anything to drink.\\nGaetz also claimed in an interview with that newspaper that he was not swerving and that the officer had said threatening things to him.\\nTampa Bay Times, Feb. 18, 2014: Less than a week later, Gaetz had his driver’s license reinstated. A field officer for the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles declared there was no evidence that Gaetz refused a breath test.\\nYet the refusal was clearly documented in Anglin’s affidavit and arrest report.\\nIt even was documented in Pinkerton’s Dec. 18 motion to dismiss charges against Gaetz.\\nThis three-page document, which Gaetz signed, states there was no evidence that he had been impaired.\\nThere was no mention of many of Anglin’s observations suggesting that Gaetz was impaired.\\nIt added a new detail: “A civilian witness drove by who knew (Gaetz) and observed no indication of impairment.”\\nYet the witness was not named, either in Pinkerton’s document or other case records at the Okaloosa County Clerk’s Office.\\nStill, this anonymous testimony is all that contradicted Anglin’s conclusion that there was probable cause to arrest Gaetz on DUI.\\nMeadows accepted Pinkerton’s motion and agreed to drop the case on Dec. 22, 2008.\\nSo, in short, we know that after the arresting officer quit amid internal allegations of improprieties and after the initial prosecutor transferred the case to avoid a conflict of interest, the new prosecutor dropped the case.\\nThere has been no evidence put forward to substantiate the claim that Gaetz’s “dad got him off.”\\nAnd while we found numerous traffic violations, such as speeding tickets, against Gaetz in Okaloosa County, we did not find any other cases in which Gaetz was charged with a DUI to support the contention that he has had “numerous DUIs.”\\nA spokesperson for Gaetz told FactCheck.org that it was “categorically false” to say the congressman had “multiple” DUI arrests, adding that Gaetz had “never been convicted of a DUI.”\\nGaetz has acknowledged the arrest in public before: In 2014, while chairing a criminal justice subcommittee in the Florida House of Representatives, he talked about his booking photo’s presence online.\\n“If anyone Googles my name, the first image that will appear is my mugshot from my arrest,” he said. “And I’m of the view that that is part of who I am.\\nI made bad decisions and [that] resulted in arrest and that is sort of something that we all live with.”\\nFollowing the unsubstantiated claim of “numerous DUIs,” the social media posts continue: “He was part of a company that had to pay 75 million in hospice fraud.\\nThey stole from dying people.” As the post is structured, readers may interpret “he” to reference Gaetz.\\nIn reality, the claim relates to a company his father founded and later sold.\\nIn 2017, Chemed Corporation and “various wholly-owned subsidiaries, including Vitas Hospice Services LLC and Vitas Healthcare Corporation” agreed to pay $75 million to settle federal charges that the companies submitted false claims for hospice services to Medicare, according to the U.S. Department of Justice.\\nVitas — which the Justice Department identified as “the largest for-profit hospice chain” in the U.S. — was co-founded by Don Gaetz.\\nRep. Matt Gaetz’s spokesperson said the congressman was never employed by Vitas.\\nFederal prosecutors claimed that “between 2002 and 2013 Vitas knowingly submitted or caused to be submitted false claims to Medicare for services to hospice patients who were not terminally ill.”\\n(Although the posts say “they stole from dying people,” the company was accused of defrauding Medicare.)\\nThe lawsuit against the company was filed in 2013 — nine years after Don Gaetz sold the company to Chemed in 2004.\\nIt’s true that at least some of the instances were alleged to have occurred before that sale date (dating back to 2002), but it’s worth noting that Don Gaetz was not a party to the lawsuit.\\nAt the time of the lawsuit’s filing, he denied that the matters in the complaint related to his work with Vitas.\\nThe elder Gaetz told the Northwest Florida Daily News that he was active in management until 2000. “I told my partners I was interested in becoming superintendent of schools, and when I got elected I said I was stepping back,” he said.\\n“I gave up all management responsibilities in 2000, though I continued as a shareholder and attended about four board meetings a year.”\\nEditor’s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.\\n“2008 CT 003553 S – State of Florida vs. Gaetz, Matthew Louis.” Okaloosa County Court Records.

Contact Berger Montague today.\\nAs the largest hospice chain in the country, Vitas has facilities located in 18 states. The company was founded in 1983 by Hugh Westbrook, Esther Colliflower and current Florida Senate President, Don Gaetz.\\nIn 2004, Gaetz and his co-founders decided to sell the company to the Cincinnati-based corporation, Chemed.\\nEarlier this month, Senator Gaetz publicly stated that he has no knowledge of the allegations contained within the False Claims Act lawsuit and is extremely disappointed to “see a company I helped found involved in something like this.”\\nChemed and Vitas, no doubt, make for strange bedfellows. Chemed is a corporation best known for providing Roto-Rooter plumbing and drain cleaning services.\\nThey have over 500 franchised Roto-Rooter offices located around the country. Chemed, whose mission statement promises “professional dignity in times of transition and sewer line clogs,” made an unusual decision when it chose to branch off into the world of hospice care.\\nThe company paid $406 million to acquire Vitas in 2004.\\nAccording to the government’s official complaint, for a duration of approximately 12 years, Vitas fraudulently billed Medicare for the terminal care of patients who were not dying or diagnosed with a terminal disease.\\nVitas is charged with knowingly and willfully billing Medicare for the hospice care of ineligible patients and submitting false reimbursement claims for medically unnecessary treatments.\\nIn order to be eligible for Medicare hospice benefits, patients must be diagnosed with a terminal illness and elect to receive palliative treatment exclusively.\\nPalliative treatment consists of medical care focused only on providing pain relief and comfort measures; there are no preventative or curative treatments associated with hospice care.\\nMedicare beneficiaries must also have a life expectancy of six months or less in order to qualify for hospice care.\\nVitas allegedly submitted hundreds of fraudulent claims to Medicare, some totaling as much as $170,000 each.\\nIn one example, Vitas submitted a $169,821 reimbursement claim to Medicare for a female patient that the hospice provider diagnosed with heart failure.\\nThe diagnosis was a red flag, as the patient had no previous or current symptoms to indicate she was suffering from any form of terminal disease, including heart disease.\\nIn fact, when the patient was originally admitted to the hospital, she was living independently in her own home and performing daily activities with no assistance.\\nIn fact, hidden within Vitas’s own medical documentation, the patient was noted to be “very healthy given her age.”\\nAllegations in the False Claims Act lawsuit also accuse Vitas of encouraging clinical staff members to admit high numbers of patients for hospice care, despite their diagnosis.\\nThe company allegedly paid out bonuses which were based on the number of patients each staff member enrolled.\\nIn addition, bonuses were handed out for those patients who were admitted for longer lengths of time.\\nAccording to the government, the bonus structure resulted in the admission of patients who were medically ineligible for hospice care.\\nOn an ethical and human level, one of the most disturbing allegations against Vitas is that the company convinced multiple patients that they were dying from a terminal illness when, in fact, they were not.\\nEven family members and friends were led to believe their loved ones were suffering from a terminal condition.\\nThe misrepresentation was allegedly necessary for Vitas to submit its false reimbursement claims to Medicare.\\nThe revolting scheme was also used as a means to convince patients that their terminal conditions would require Vitas hospice services.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Illinois Hospice Executive Charged with Federal Health Care Fraud for Allegedly Falsely Elevating Level of Patients’ Care\\nCHICAGO—An owner of an Illinois hospice company was charged with federal health care fraud for allegedly engaging in an extensive scheme to obtain higher Medicare and Medicaid payments by fraudulently elevating the level of hospice care for patients, many of whom resided at nursing homes he also controlled across the state.\\nIn many instances, the level of hospice care allegedly exceeded what was medically necessary or actually provided, including for some patients who did not have terminal illnesses or who were enrolled far longer―sometimes for several years―than the required life expectancy of six months or less.\\nThe defendant, Seth Gillman, 46, of Lincolnwood, was charged with one count each of health care fraud and obstructing a federal audit in a criminal complaint that was filed late Friday in U.S. District Court.\\nHe is scheduled to appear at 3 p.m. today before Magistrate Judge Geraldine Soat Brown in federal court.\\nGillman, an attorney, is the corporate agent, administrator, and one-fourth owner of Passages Hospice LLC, based in west suburban Lisle, and is also the agent and secretary of Asta Healthcare Company Inc., which operates Asta Care Center nursing homes in Bloomington, Colfax, Elgin, Ford County, Pontiac, Rockford, and Toluca, Illinois.\\nPassages did not have its own inpatient facility but instead deployed nurses to visit hospice patients in nursing homes and private residences.\\nAs Passages grew, it divided its operations into geographic regions covering Chicago and the western suburbs, Rockford, Bloomington, and Belleville, with different nurses, nursing directors, and medical directors for each region.\\nThe charges allege that between August 2008 and January 2012, Gillman trained and caused to be trained Passages nurses to look for signs that allegedly would qualify a hospice patient for general inpatient care (GIP), resulting in higher payments per day, compared to routine care.\\nGillman allegedly knew that many of Passages’ patients were improperly being placed on GIP, in part as a result of a 2009 review of patient files, a 2009 report by an outside consultant, and a 2010 internal audit.\\nGillman also knew that some patients were placed on GIP without a medical director’s approval.\\nIn fiscal year 2012, Medicare’s daily reimbursement for GIP was $671.84, while the daily payment for routine care was $151.23.\\nAccording to claims data, from January 2006 to late 2011, Passages submitted claims for approximately 4,769 patients to Medicare and/or Medicaid and was paid approximately $95 million from Medicare and approximately $30 million from Medicaid.\\nBetween July 2008 and late 2011, Passages was paid approximately $23 million by Medicare for claimed GIP services, in addition to Medicaid payments for claimed GIP services submitted on behalf of more than 200 patients.\\nAccording to a 69-page affidavit in support of the charges, federal agents have interviewed patients, family members, and more than 30 former and current employees of Passages, including several who reported allegedly fraudulent billing and marketing practices to Medicare and/or law enforcement before they were contacted by agents.\\nInvestigators have also reviewed e-mails, documents, and patient files that were obtained in response to a 2011 civil investigative demand, a January 2012 search warrant, and subpoenas issued in 2013, as well as claims data from Medicare and Medicaid.\\nMedicare claims data revealed that approximately 22 percent of Passages’ patients between 2006 and late 2011 had more than six months of hospice care, with 28 patients receiving more than 1,000 days of hospice care in that period.\\nBy contrast, according to the National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization, only 11.8 percent of all hospice patients in 2009 were on hospice care for longer than six months.\\nFor example, the complaint affidavit cites Patient JW, who was admitted to an Asta nursing home in 2003 following a major stroke, and Passages billed for more than 2,000 days of hospice services.\\nIn another example, Passages submitted bills for 1,443 days of hospice care for Patient LJ, who was admitted to an Asta nursing home in 2001.\\nPatient LJ’s son told investigators that his mother appeared in no danger of dying until the last month of her life.\\nThe charges also cite Medicare claims data showing that Passages’ billing for GIP services grew significantly.\\nIn 2010, Passages billed approximately 1,161 GIP patient days to Medicare monthly, and the figure rose to 1,430 GIP patient days a month through the first nine months of 2011.\\nThe average GIP payments that Passages received per month was $4,437 in the period from mid-2006 to mid-2008, and the monthly payments increased to $946,743 in 2011.\\nA hospice physician retained by the government reviewed files for 13 Passages patients, 10 of whose admissions exceed six months and extended to as many as 1,598 days over two admission periods.\\nThe government’s expert found that nine of the 13 patients were not eligible for Medicare hospice benefits for part or all of their admission and that all the 503 days of GIP submitted for those patients were improper and excessive.\\nA woman, identified as Individual E in the affidavit, who helped Gillman and his father start Passages and served as its clinical director for several years until she was fired told agents that Gillman said if a patient was under Passages’ care, they were sick enough to warrant GIP care.\\nWhen Individual E confronted Gillman over the GIP eligibility of Patient DB, Gillman allegedly told her to mind her own business because he needed the money, the affidavit states.\\nThe charges further allege that in the fall of 2008, Gillman began paying bonuses, sometimes well in excess of their salary, to Passages’ directors overseeing nurses and certified nursing assistants based on the amount of GIP under their supervision.\\nGillman also authorized large bonuses to himself and a co-administrator, Individual A, based on the number of patients per day at certain nursing homes in the Belleville region, including $833,375 to himself between March 2009 and April 2011.\\nThe bonuses increased as the number of patients on GIP increased and as the number of facilities counted for the bonuses increased, according to the affidavit.\\nPassages also allegedly had arrangements with approximately eight nursing homes in 2010 in which it paid the nursing homes $250 for every patient who was on GIP per day.\\nThe obstructing a federal audit count alleges that in August and September 2009, Gillman, Individual A, and others oversaw and conducted an effort to alter patient files that had been requested by TrustSolutions, which contracted with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to audit providers for fraud and abuse.\\nSeveral former Passages employees have admitted to agents their involvement in the altering of patient files in the summer of 2009 as well as in another session in 2010, the affidavit states.\\nThe charges were announced by Zachary T. Fardon, United States Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois; Lamont Pugh, III, Special Agent in Charge of the Chicago Regional Office of the HHS-OIG; and Robert J. Holley, Special Agent in Charge of the Chicago Office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\\nThe Illinois Attorney General’s Office is also participating in the investigation.\\nThe government is being represented by Assistant U.S. Attorney Stephen C. Lee.\\nHealth care fraud carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine, and obstructing a federal audit carries a maximum of five years in prison and a $250,000 fine, and restitution is mandatory.\\nIf convicted, the court must impose a reasonable sentence under federal statutes and the advisory United States Sentencing Guidelines.\\nThe public is reminded that a complaint is not evidence of guilt. The defendant is presumed innocent and is entitled to a fair trial at which the government has the burden of proving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\\nThe Medicare Fraud Strike Force began operating in Chicago in February 2011 and consists of agents from the FBI and HHS-OIG working together with prosecutors from the U.S. Attorney’s Office and the Justice Department’s Fraud Section.\\nThe strike force is are part of the Health Care Fraud Prevention and Enforcement Action Team (HEAT), a joint initiative announced in May 2009 between the Department of Justice and HHS to focus their efforts to prevent and deter fraud and enforce current anti-fraud laws around the country.\\nScores of defendants have been charged locally in health care fraud cases since the strike force began operating in Chicago.\\nTo report health care fraud to learn more about the Health Care Fraud Prevention and Enforcement Action Team (HEAT), go to www.stopmedicarefraud.gov.')]"

      "Republican Matt Gaetz was part of a company that had to pay 75 million in hospice fraud. They stole from dying people. \n",
      "---\n",
      "In recent months, a national writer for Mother Jones magazine named Stephanie Mencimer has been digging into a story about the local roots of FloridaMan and U.S. Congressman Matt Gaetz.\n",
      "It finally dropped last week. And it should be mandatory reading for residents of the Panhandle who need to understand just how badly our community has been conned by small and corrupt confederacy political players who created Matt Gaetz.\n",
      "Here are just a few highlights from Mencimer’s work:\n",
      "► While Matt rants against boogeymen like \"socialism\" and \"leftist\" healthcare hijackers, the Gaetz family money came from a hospice company called \"Vitas\" that profited from Medicare and Medicaid payments.\n",
      "The company made the Gaetz family rich when they sold it. And later, it was sued by the Justice Department for allegedly defrauding Medicare, as Mencimer explains:\n",
      "“In 2004, Don Gaetz and his partners cashed in, selling the hospice company to the parent company of the plumbing behemoth Roto-Rooter for $400 million.\n",
      "When he ran for state Senate two years later, Don had a net worth of $25 million. In 2013, the Justice Department sued Vitas, alleging that between 2002 and 2013, the company had defrauded Medicare by filing false claims for services never provided or for patients who weren’t terminally ill.\n",
      "The company settled the case in 2017 for more than $75 million, at the time the largest settlement ever recovered from a hospice company.”\n",
      "Mencimer noted that Don Gaetz wasn’t named in the case and has denied any wrongdoing. But the fact is our so-called \"conservative\" congressman's family made millions on the backs of taxpayers.\n",
      "The \"free market\" is fantastic when the public provides your payday.\n",
      "► With links to a disgraced former Florida House Speaker, the branches of the Panhandle political tree are as crooked as they come.\n",
      "For a congressman who rails against corruption and preaches political purity, Gaetz's hometown political roots are downright dirty.\n",
      "“Less than a year after his drunk-driving arrest, he declared his candidacy for the state House seat in Florida’s 4th District, which was about to be vacated by House Speaker Ray Sansom, a friend of Don Gaetz for whom Matt had worked as a legislative aide during law school.\n",
      "In April 2009, Sansom was indicted on corruption charges, accused of tweaking the state budget to funnel more than $25 million to Northwest Florida State College in Niceville.\n",
      "Of those funds, $6 million was earmarked to build a hangar at the Destin airport for a jet company owned by one of Sansom’s friends and donors, real estate developer Jay Odom.\n",
      "Odom was also a client of Matt Gaetz, who handled Odom’s hangar lease. (In 2013, Odom would be sentenced to six months in prison for illegally funneling $23,000 into former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee’s failed 2008 presidential campaign.\n",
      "In the past decade, Odom has contributed thousands of dollars to Gaetz’s political campaigns. Odom did not respond to an interview request.)\"\n",
      "Joe Scarborough got a mention along with Jeb Bush for being campaign contributors to the Gaetzes. And Lewis Bear is mentioned only as “a Pensacola beer baron,” which conjures images of Snoopy doing aerial combat if there was a Budweiser logo on the side of his red dog house.\n",
      "The point is that Matt isn't self-made. He was manufactured by an unimpressive network of Huckabees and Sansoms and Odoms and \"beer barons\" and Fish House fundraisers who would all be non-influential nobodies in any other part of the state.\n",
      "But in the small pond of the Panhandle, a few fat fish have foisted a phony congressman on the rest of us.\n",
      "► The boy who cries “fake news” may have lied to his father about visiting wounded veterans in Walter Reed Hospital, because regrettably, his father mislead readers of this newspaper about it.\n",
      "In a 2017 column about charitable Christmas giving, Don Gaetz wrote, “Matt goes to Walter Reed Hospital in Washington, D.C. every week to visit warfighters from our area who are fighting the battle after the battle.\n",
      "Their struggle now is to reclaim their health, their mobility and their lives. Matt says we can never do enough for them and their families.\n",
      "He chokes up, a rare thing for him, when we donate in his name to support veterans’ housing, rehabilitative care, jobs.”\n",
      "It was an emotional and heart-wrenching image. A congressman so personally moved by the price paid by wounded warriors that he visited them on a weekly basis.\n",
      "Mencimer fact-checked the claim and found out this: “In reality, Matt Gaetz has made only two visits to wounded vets at Walter Reed since taking office, the last one in September 2017.\n",
      "Keep that little tidbit in mind the next time you hear from the boy who cries “fake news.” You might not be a fan of this newspaper.\n",
      "But I’ve never heard of a reporter or an idiot cartoonist lying to the public about weekly visits to wounded veterans.\n",
      "► Mencimer detailed a shady scheme to funnel family money to Matt once Jeff Miller announced his retirement in 2016.\n",
      "“In just six years, his net worth had dwindled from nearly $1 million to $388,000, according to his financial disclosures.\n",
      "Most of that was tied up in property he owned. He had less than $90,000 in liquid assets.\n",
      "“Yet less than three weeks after Miller announced his retirement, Gaetz dumped $100,000 into his own campaign.\n",
      "Four months later, he gave another $100,000... It would have been illegal for Don Gaetz to lend six figures to the campaign, but he appears to have found another way to funnel money to his son’s race.”\n",
      "“Public records and financial disclosure forms show that in the days following Miller’s retirement announcement, Matt Gaetz sold a house he owned for just under $100,000.\n",
      "Three months later, he sold several vacant lots he’d bought years earlier. All of Gaetz’s real estate was purchased by the same buyer: a company called Treveron, which, it turns out, is owned by his dad.”\n",
      "Mencimer said the transactions fall into a “gray area” of campaign finance law. So they weren’t necessarily illegal.\n",
      "But for a conman who pushes the myth and morals of a hard work ethic and personal responsibility, it’s just more evidence of the grand illusion that has duped so many suckers in Northwest Florida into buying the Gaetz bag of buffalo chips.\n",
      "Mencimer even wrote about the 37-year-old's effort to conceal details about his love life that contradict his self-righteous claims of moral authority and true-conservatism.\n",
      "“Two years ago, a former staffer sent him a blunt text message about a 21-year-old woman Gaetz was dating, who would later become a Democratic congressional intern, urging him to ask the woman to delete photos of him from her Instagram account.\n",
      "The staffer wrote, “Don’t be surprised if many of the conservatives and competitors, like Cris Dosev in Florida CD1, may frown upon her sexually explicit images, her videos showcasing her multiple capabilities to smoke weed, and her flagrant application of language as antithetical to the values of Northwest Florida.”\n",
      "It’s fitting that Matt has become one of the biggest pushers of marijuana policies in Florida. The Panhandle has been dazed and hazed by the phony persona of a family-financed self-promoter who in reality, has almost nothing in common with the vast majority of working class folks and families here in the Florida Panhandle.\n",
      "Maybe Gaetz is just a sign of the times, an organism of the ecosystem, and a perfectly predictable politician for our phony modern era of Kardashian selfies, Facebook “memories”, self-staring smartphones and patriotism emblazoned on red hats made in China.\n",
      "Of course it’s all a cheap and corny sham. Many things are these days.\n",
      "And maybe we just can't tell the difference anymore.\n",
      "Or maybe with reporting like this from Mencimer and Mother Jones, we don’t really have any excuse for not knowing better.\n",

      "Largest US hospice company sued for Medicare fraud\n",
      "A lawsuit filed by the U.S. Department of Justice asserts that Vitas Hospice Services, a company founded in 1983 by a group that included state Senate President Don Gaetz, submitted fraudulent bills for Medicare payment.\n",
      "The lawsuit alleges that for 12 years Vitas “violated the False Claims Act and misspent tens of millions of taxpayer dollars” by billing Medicare “for ineligible patients and inflated levels of care,” a Department of Justice news release said.\n",
      "Gaetz said Thursday that he has not been contacted about the complaint and was not a party to it.\n",
      "“I have no direct knowledge of the complaint that’s been made, but it is heartbreaking to see a company I helped found involved in something like this,” he said.\n",
      "Vitas is the largest hospice care chain in the country.\n",
      "The Justice Department claims the Medicare fraud was occurring in 2001, three years before Gaetz and his partners sold the company.\n",
      "But Gaetz said he remained active in the management of Vitas only until 2000. He stepped aside that year when he was elected superintendent of the Okaloosa County School District.\n",
      "“I told my partners I was interested in becoming superintendent of schools, and when I got elected I said I was stepping back,” said Gaetz, who lives in Niceville.\n",
      "“I gave up all management responsibilities in 2000, though I continued as a shareholder and attended about four board meetings a year.”\n",
      "In 2004, Gaetz and fellow Vitas founders Hugh Westbrook and Esther Colliflower sold their stock in the company to Cincinnati-based Chemed for $406 million.\n",
      "The Justice Department alleges Vitas Hospice and Vitas Healthcare submitted claims for unneeded emergency services for patients or services that weren’t provided, the Associated Press has reported.\n",
      "The companies pressured their employees to submit more claims to get more revenue, the AP said.\n",
      "Gaetz said he is not clear on the merits of the case against Vitas Hospice Services LLC, Vitas Healthcare Corp. and Chemed.\n",
      "“My understanding is that the owners and operators of the company are aggressively denying the complaint,” he said.\n",
      "Gaetz said he recognizes that different management priorities can evolve when a conglomerate takes over a company from its founders.\n",
      "“I would say there are people who are still caring employees of Vitas that were there when I was involved,” he said.\n",
      "“They are good people that I feel bad for, having to defend against this complaint.”\n",
      "An Associated Press version of this story is posted below:\n",
      "FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) — The Department of Justice is suing the hospice company founded by Florida's Senate president, accusing it of submitting tens of millions of dollars in fraudulent Medicare claims for more than a decade, including while Don Gaetz was vice chairman of the board.\n",
      "Vitas Hospice and Vitas Healthcare submitted claims for emergency services for patients that weren't needed, weren't provided, or were provided to patients who weren't eligible under Medicare requirements, according to the DOJ.\n",
      "The companies set goals for the number of crisis-care days to be billed and pressured their employees to submit more claims so it would get more revenue, the lawsuit said.\n",
      "The agency said Medicare payments for crisis care can be hundreds of dollars greater than typical hospice care payments.\n",
      "Vitas is the largest U.S. hospice care chain, and its parent company Chemed Corp. said the claims go back to 2002, two years before it acquired the company.\n",
      "Gaetz told The Associated Press on Thursday that he has not been involved with the management of the company for about 13 years, saying he gave up a management role in 2000 when he became Okaloosa County's school superintendent.\n",
      "He founded the company in the early 1980s with Rev. Hugh Westbrook, a Democratic activist, and Esther Colliflower, a nurse.\n",
      "Starting with an $1,800 investment, they turned Vitas into the largest company of its kind before selling it for millions to Chemed in 2004.\n",
      "That's made Gaetz, R-Niceville, one of the Legislature's wealthiest members with a net worth of about $25 million.\n",
      "\"I continued to be a shareholder and member of the board of directors until the company was sold in 2004,\" he said, adding that he doesn't currently \"own a single share of stock and I have no role with the company in any capacity.\"\n",
      "Gaetz was vice chairman of the board during part of the time that federal investigators allege the fraud took place, but he said he had no \"role in the operation of the company\" when he served as vice-chair.\n",
      "\"It's heartbreaking to see an organization which I remember as one of the formative change agents in end-of-life care in this country having to deal with a complaint like this but it's not something that I have any knowledge of or any connection with,\" he said.\n",
      "Chemed said in a statement that it will fight the lawsuit \"vigorously.\"\n",
      "The lawsuit was filed Thursday, the night before the Florida session ended. The next day, shares of Chemed lost $14.27, or 17.5 percent of their value, to $67.52 in afternoon trading.\n",
      "The Justice Department says Medicare reimburses hospice care for patients who are suffering from a terminal illness and who are expected to live six months or less if the disease progresses at its normal rate.\n",
      "Patients receiving hospice care are treated for pain and stress and symptoms but don't receive treatment for their illnesses.\n",
      "Those patients can get \"crisis care\" if they need immediate, short-term care from nurses or else hospitalization will be required.\n",
      "The department says the crisis care rate is the highest daily rate a hospice can bill Medicare.\n",
      "\"The government contends that Chemed and Vitas violated the False Claims Act and misspent tens of millions of taxpayer dollars from the Medicare program,\" the Justice Department said in a news release.\n",
      "Cincinnati-based Chemed said the government can seek statutory penalties, costs, and triple damages. Those are typically allowed in whistleblower lawsuits.\n",
      "\"Chemed and Vitas have made significant investments in controls, systems and procedures to uphold the highest industry standards and to maintain compliance with all regulatory requirements,\" the company said.\n",
      "\"Our compliance efforts are designed to ensure our services are provided only to eligible patients.\"\n",
      "Medicare fraud costs taxpayers an estimated $60 billion a year and federal officials frequently point to Florida, particularly South Florida, as ground zero for the complex scams.\n",
      "Florida Gov. Rick Scott was ousted from his role as CEO of Columbia/HCA after a Medicare fraud investigation led to the company paying a $1.7 billion settlement.\n",
      "TALLAHASSEE — The U.S. Department of Justice has sued the hospice company founded by Florida Senate President Don Gaetz, accusing the company of engaging in Medicare fraud for more than 11 years, including during the time Gaetz was vice chairman.\n",
      "The lawsuit, filed May 2 in the district court for the western district of Missouri, alleges that since at least 2002 Vitas Hospice Services and Vitas Healthcare Corp., the largest provider of for-profit hospice services in the country, \"misspent tens of millions of taxpayer dollars from the Medicare program.\"\n",
      "Gaetz sold the company in 2004 to its current owner, Cincinnati-based Chemed, and reportedly no longer owns any shares or has any affiliation with the company.\n",
      "Chemed operates hospice services in 18 states including Florida.\n",
      "The suit, filed on the eve of the final day of the legislative session, alleges that Chemed and its hospice subsidiaries defrauded Medicare by billing the agency for patients who were not eligible for hospice care, and for charging Medicare for crisis care given to patients who either didn't need it or never received it.\n",
      "Gaetz, R-Niceville, who was elected to the Senate in 2006, said through a spokeswoman late Wednesday that the Department of Justice complaint involves issues that occurred after he left the company.\n",
      "\"For the past nine years, President Gaetz has not owned any stock in the company or served in any capacity as an employee, officer, director, consultant or volunteer,'' said Katie Betta, Gaetz's spokeswoman.\n",
      "\"The complaint relates to matters long after President Gaetz sold his interest in the company.\"\n",
      "The company said in a statement issued May 3 that it intends \"to defend this lawsuit vigorously.\"\n",
      "Under federal law, only dying patients with six or fewer months to live are eligible to receive Medicare-reimbursed hospice care and only patients \"experiencing an acute crisis that requires the immediate and short-term provision of skilled nursing services\" are eligible to receive so-called crisis care, the most costly form of hospice care, according to the complaint.\n",
      "In 2013, for example, Medicare's daily reimbursement rate for crisis care was $742 more per patient than the daily rate for routine home care, the complaint said.\n",
      "The lawsuit alleges that Vitas Healthcare systematically attempted to overcharge Medicare for services that were either not provided or given to patients who were not eligible for the level of care billed to Medicare.\n",
      "The Justice Department also claims the company used aggressive marketing tactics and pressured staff to increase the number of crisis care claims submitted to Medicare and set goals for the number of days that were to be billed.\n",
      "The complaint cites the example of a California patient identified only as \"MC.\" Vitas reported that the patient was eligible for Medicare-reimbursed hospice care, the complaint alleges, but the company's own records stated that MC did not have a terminal illness whose prognosis was six months or less.\n",
      "She was instead, \"living independently and performing daily activities without assistance,\" including doing her own laundry.\n",
      "The cost to Medicare for crisis care for MC was $170,999 between 2009 and 2012, according to the complaint.\n",
      "The Justice Department found that Vitas' billings for crisis care was almost six times higher than the national average.\n",
      "A Vitas nurse reported that on more than one occasion she arrived at the home of a patient described by Vitas as needing crisis care but instead would find the patient \"at church, at the beauty parlor, or playing bingo,\" the complaint said.\n",
      "Despite the fact that these patients did not need or receive crisis care, the complaint alleges that Vitas billed Medicare for the services anyway.\n",
      "Gaetz founded Vitas Healthcare as a nonprofit, Hospice Care Inc., in Miami in early 1978 with partners Hugh Westbrook and Esther Colliflower.\n",
      "That same year, Gaetz and Westbrook helped pass Florida's hospice licensure law, which gave his hospice a 20-year head start over for-profit competitors.\n",
      "Florida's hospice act was the first such law in the nation and became the model for the federal Medicare/Medicaid hospice benefit plan that Congress enacted in 1982.\n",
      "The company became a for-profit company in 1984 and changed its name to Vitas Healthcare in 1992.\n",
      "Gaetz and his partners sold Vitas for $406 million to Cincinnati-based Chemed, best known as the owner of Roto-Rooter.\n"
