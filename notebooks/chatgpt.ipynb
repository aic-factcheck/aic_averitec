      "A: Yes\n",
      "\n",
      "Q: What is an example of how the UK Job Support Scheme works?\n",
      "A: The Government example is:\n",
      "\n",
      "Beth normally works 5 days a week and earns ¬£350 a week. Her Company is suffering with reduced sales due to Coronavirus. Rather than making Beth redundant, the company puts Beth on the Job Support Scheme, working 2 days a week (40% of her usual hours).\n",
      "Her employer pays Beth ¬£140 for the days she works.\n",
      "And for the time she is not working (3 days or 60%, worth ¬£210), she will also earn2/3, or ¬£140, bringing her total earnings to ¬£280, 80% of her normal wage.\n",
      "The Government will give a grant worth ¬£70 (1/3 of hours not worked, equivalent to 20% of her normal wages) to Beth‚Äôs employer to support them in keeping Beth‚Äôs job.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q: What are the requirements for making a claim?\n",
      "A: In order to make the claim, the employee must work at least 33% of their usual hours for the job to be seen as ‚Äòviable‚Äô and therefore eligible under this scheme. The Government will then pay a third of the hours not worked (up to a cap), with the employer also contributing a third. The remaining unpaid third is effectively the employee‚Äôs contribution to the scheme. This means that an employee earns 77% of their normal wage where the Government contribution has not been capped.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q: Is the UK Job Support Scheme as generous as the furlough scheme?\n",
      "A: This scheme is by no means as generous as the previous ‚Äòfurlough‚Äô scheme and until further guidance is announced it is unclear whether it will be of any tangible benefit to company directors (who may typically be paid a modest PAYE salary, at the National Insurance earnings threshold).\n",

      "Q: What Caused Most Deaths in 1918 Spanish Flu  Influenza/Pandemic ?\n",
      "A: The majority of deaths during the influenza pandemic of 1918-1919 were not caused by the influenza virus acting alone, report researchers from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health. Instead, most victims succumbed to bacterial pneumonia following influenza virus infection. The pneumonia was caused when bacteria that normally inhabit the nose and throat invaded the lungs along a pathway created when the virus destroyed the cells that line the bronchial tubes and lungs.\n",
      "\n",
      "A future influenza pandemic may unfold in a similar manner, say the NIAID authors, whose paper in the Oct. 1 issue of The Journal of Infectious Diseases is now available online. Therefore, the authors conclude, comprehensive pandemic preparations should include not only efforts to produce new or improved influenza vaccines and antiviral drugs but also provisions to stockpile antibiotics and bacterial vaccines as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "The work presents complementary lines of evidence from the fields of pathology and history of medicine to support this conclusion. \"The weight of evidence we examined from both historical and modern analyses of the 1918 influenza pandemic favors a scenario in which viral damage followed by bacterial pneumonia led to the vast majority of deaths,\" says co-author NIAID Director Anthony S. Fauci, M.D. \"In essence, the virus landed the first blow while bacteria delivered the knockout punch.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "NIAID co-author and pathologist Jeffery Taubenberger, M.D., Ph.D., examined lung tissue samples from 58 soldiers who died of influenza at various U. S. military bases in 1918 and 1919. The samples, preserved in paraffin blocks, were re-cut and stained to allow microscopic evaluation. Examination revealed a spectrum of tissue damage \"ranging from changes characteristic of the primary viral pneumonia and evidence of tissue repair to evidence of severe, acute, secondary bacterial pneumonia,\" says Dr. Taubenberger. In most cases, he adds\n",
      "\n",
      "Q: Did Dr Anthony Fauci publication blame masks for 1918-19 flu deaths ?\n",
      "A: Medical and scientific experts now agree that bacteria, not influenza viruses, were the greatest cause of death during the 1918 flu pandemic.\n",
      "\n",
      "Government efforts to gird for the next influenza pandemic ‚Äì bird flu or otherwise ‚Äì ought to take notice and stock up on antibiotics, says John Brundage, a medical microbiologist at the Armed Forces Health Surveillance Center in Silver Spring, Maryland.\n",
      "\n",
      "Brundage‚Äôs team culled first-hand accounts, medical records and infection patterns from 1918 and 1919. Although a nasty strain of flu virus swept around the world, bacterial pneumonia that came on the heels of mostly mild cases of flu killed the majority of the 20 to 100 million victims of the so-called Spanish flu, they conclude.\n",
      "\n",
      "‚ÄúWe agree completely that bacterial pneumonia played a major role in the mortality of the 1918 pandemic,‚Äù says Anthony Fauci, director of National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Disease in Bethesda, Maryland, and author of another journal article out next month that comes to a similar conclusion.\n",

      "A: As of October 15, 216,025 deaths from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been reported in the United States*; however, this number might underestimate the total impact of the pandemic on mortality. Measures of excess deaths have been used to estimate the impact of public health pandemics or disasters, particularly when there are questions about underascertainment of deaths directly attributable to a given event or cause (1‚Äì6).‚Ä† Excess deaths are defined as the number of persons who have died from all causes, in excess of the expected number of deaths for a given place and time. This report describes trends and demographic patterns in excess deaths during January 26‚ÄìOctober 3, 2020. Expected numbers of deaths were estimated using overdispersed Poisson regression models with spline terms to account for seasonal patterns, using provisional mortality data from CDC‚Äôs National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) (7). Weekly numbers of deaths by age group and race/ethnicity were assessed to examine the difference between the weekly number of deaths occurring in 2020 and the average number occurring in the same week during 2015‚Äì2019 and the percentage change in 2020. Overall, an estimated 299,028 excess deaths have occurred in the United States from late January through October 3, 2020, with two thirds of these attributed to COVID-19. The largest percentage increases were seen among adults aged 25‚Äì44 years and among Hispanic or Latino (Hispanic) persons. These results provide information about the degree to which COVID-19 deaths might be underascertained and inform efforts to prevent mortality directly or indirectly associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, such as efforts to minimize disruptions to health care.\n",
      "\n",

      "A: Based on NVSS data, excess deaths have occurred every week in the United States since March 2020. An estimated 299,028 more persons than expected have died since January 26, 2020; approximately two thirds of these deaths were attributed to COVID-19. A recent analysis of excess deaths from March through July reported very similar findings, but that study did not include more recent data through September (5).\n",
      "\n",
      "Although more excess deaths have occurred among older age groups, relative to past years, adults aged 25‚Äì44 years have experienced the largest average percentage increase in the number of deaths from all causes from late January through October 3, 2020. The age distribution of COVID-19 deaths shifted toward younger age groups from May through August (9); however, these disproportionate increases might also be related to underlying trends in other causes of death. Future analyses might shed light on the extent to which increases among younger age groups are driven by COVID-19 or by other causes of death. Among racial and ethnic groups, the smallest average percentage increase in numbers of deaths compared with previous years occurred among White persons (11.9%) and the largest for Hispanic persons (53.6%), with intermediate increases (28.9%‚Äì36.6%) among AI/AN, Black, and Asian persons. These disproportionate increases among certain racial and ethnic groups are consistent with noted disparities in COVID-19 mortality.***\n",
      "\n",
      "The findings in this report are subject to at least five limitations. First, the weighting of provisional NVSS mortality data might not fully account for reporting lags, particularly in recent weeks. Estimated numbers of deaths in the most recent weeks are likely underestimated and will increase as more data become available. Second, there is uncertainty associated with the models used to generate the expected numbers of deaths in a given week. A range of values for excess death estimates is provided elsewhere (7), but these ranges might not refl\n",
