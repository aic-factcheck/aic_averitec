Finance Minister Patrick Chinamasa promised in a budget speech last week to re-engage with international lenders, curb spending and attract investors to revive the economy. '}, page_content='The African Export and Import Bank has pledged up to $1.5 billion in new loans and financial guarantees to Zimbabwe in a major boost for new President Emmerson Mnangagwa\\'s government, the bank\\'s president and chairman said Tuesday. Mnangagwa, who took over last month after veteran autocrat Robert Mugabe quit following a de facto military coup, has vowed to focus on reviving the struggling economy and provide jobs in a nation with an unemployment rate exceeding 80 percent. Afreximbank was the only international lender that stood by Zimbabwe throughout Mugabe\\'s repressive 37-year rule, but its quick announcement of a fresh package of loans and guarantees appeared to be a vote of confidence in the new government. Cairo-based Afreximbank was a major funder of Zimbabwe while the country was cut off from the International Monetary Fund and World Bank for having defaulted on its debt in 1999. Bank president and chairman Okey Oramah told reporters after a meeting with Mnangagwa and senior government officials that Afreximbank would provide $150 million to local banks to help them pay for outstanding critical imports. \"We also discussed a number of other areas that involve additional investment from us for something that will be in the order of $1 billion to $1.5 billion that will include certain kinds of guarantees to encourage investors to come to Zimbabwe. \"We ... want to make sure that we support the stabilization of the economy, that means providing liquidity to make sure that the situation where people are rushing every time to look for cash is dealt with,\" Oramah said. In August, before Mugabe\\'s ouster, Afreximbank provided $600 million to help Zimbabwe pay for imports and $300 million to allow it to print more \"bond notes,\" a quasi-currency that officially trades on par with the U.S. dollar. Zimbabwe has a foreign debt of more than $7 billion and in September said it would not be able to pay $1.8 billion in arrears to the World Bank and African Development Bank until economic fundamentals improved.

The Afreximbank Trade Debt-backed Securities (AFTRADES) will be provided to participating banks as debt securities that could be used as collateral for interbank funds placements in order to promote interbank dealings among Zimbabwean Banks active in trade finance, according to the terms of a memorandum of understanding signed on by Afreximbank, the Zimbabwe Ministry of Finance and Economic Development and the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe. “Our objective is to use this facility to enable trade finance banks in Zimbabwe to access much-needed liquidity from cash-surplus banks in the country, thereby increasing their capacity to deepen their trade finance activities,” said Jean-Louis Ekra, President of Afreximbank, after signing the memorandum of understanding in Cairo on 10 February. Patrick Chinamasa, Minister of Finance and Economic Planning, and Dr. Charity L. Dhliwayo, Acting Governor of the Reserve Bank, had signed it on 31 January on behalf of the Zimbabwean parties. Mr. Ekra said that Afreximbank’s decision to introduce the facility was motivated by its recognition of the serious constraints limiting the access of Zimbabwe’s trade finance banks to funding as a result of the liquidity challenge confronting the financial sector. Under the terms of the memorandum of understanding, AFTRADES would be structured as a collateral swap involving the issuance of securities by Afreximbank to participating banks in exchange for trade–related collateral or securities presented by those banks. \\nThe Government of Zimbabwe, through the Ministry of Finance and Economic Development, will serve as the facility’s guarantor and liquidity support contributor, up to agreed levels, while the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe will grant the regulatory approvals required by the participating banks. In addition, the Reserve Bank will provide the infrastructure required for the implementation and administration of the facility. Only solvent banks which are not facing fundamental problems of viability will be eligible for the facility, according to the memorandum. The African Export Import Bank was established in October 1993 by African governments, African private and institutional investors, and non-African investors to finance and promote intra- and extra-African trade. Its two basic constitutive documents are the Establishment Agreement, which gives it the status of an international organization, and the Charter, which governs its corporate structure and operations. Since 1994, the Bank has approved more than $25 billion in credit facilities in support of African trade, including $3.71 billion in 2012. \\n'), Evidence(question=\"What percentage of Afreximbank's total loans does the amount provided to Zimbabwe represent?\", answer='The loans provided to Zimbabwe ($2.1 billion) represent approximately 4.1% of the total loans provided by Afreximbank ($51 billion).', url='https://www.centralbanking.com/central-banks/reserves/foreign-exchange/4072761/zimbabwe-borrows-985-million-from-pan-african-lenders', scraped_text='\\nZimbabwe borrows $985 million from pan-African lenders The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) has borrowed $985 million from pan-African lending institutions to cover import of basic products, governor John Mangudya told the country’s parliament on March 4.

ANOVA analysis is used to analyze the group effect. The p value is less than 2e-16 for the log 2 transformed case comparison, suggesting that the two groups are statistically significantly different. The Asian mask-wearing group clearly has lower growth rates of COVID-19 cases compared to the non-mask-wearing group. Thailand has the highest growth rate among the mask-wearing groups. However, the differences in the growth rate of confirmed cases between these two groups cannot be fully attributed to mask-wearing, but arise from many factors, such as clinical tests performed, complicated social, economic, and cultural differences, and varied public health polices enforcement. The preliminary comparison only provides the rationale to further evaluate if wearing masks is effective for controlling the infectious disease outbreak. Our study has six major assumptions with preliminary evidence. First, the SARS-CoV-2 transmission pathway includes airborne [1, 8, 22–24] with an R0 value exceeding that of influenza and SARS [16, 32, 33]. Second, a proportion of infected cases could be asymptomatic [36, 38, 46, 47]. Third, asymptomatic individuals could transfer the virus in the community [48, 49, 82]. Fourth, the public awareness of mask usage may increase as the pandemic spreads [64]. Fifth, the market could respond to consumer demand with a production increase and without supply chain problems [67]. Sixth, homemade cloth masks are not as effective as commercial medical masks [57, 60]. Thus, we project the best scenario as the pandemic spreads and by the end of the outbreak, the general population will be willing to wear a mask. Although wearing a mask is a low-cost and non-disruptive measure, wearing a mask has not been culturally widespread in many parts of the world [83]. Furthermore, for non-certified medical masks, individual errors could lead to ineffective mask fitting, which could reduce the benefit of wearing a mask [84]. \\nThere are limitations to those six assumptions. First, a recent study suggested that the virus was detected on the outer layer of COVID-19 patients' masks [85], which could invalidate the utility of a patient wearing a mask. However, although the virus was detected, the mask could still provide prevention by reducing the virus load to an adjacent healthy individual. Further studies on asymptomatic individuals wearing masks could be more convincing to validate the effectiveness of wearing a mask to prevent pre-symptomatic transmission. Second, we assume random mixing and model the general population, but have not taken account children's role. Children are less likely to wear masks consistently to realize mask effectiveness. At the same time, the role of children in COVID-19 transmission is unclear [86]. Third, we assume the willing individual who has a mask can use the mask in the right manner and follow social distancing and other personal hygiene practices. There are discrepancies between willingness, perceived compliance, and real compliance [87]. Fourth, research shows that masks can be a source of contamination if not disposed of or replaced in timely manner The COVID-19 pandemic has created a global crisis. Prevention such as vaccines is one of the most effective measures to mitigate such a catastrophic public health crisis. Prior to an available vaccine, NPIs such as wearing a mask can potentially reduce the virus transmission rate. Recent modeling studies suggest that timely and comprehensive NPIs are needed to prevent a secondary wave of COVID-19 [89]. However, timely implementations of NPI such as wearing a mask call for public awareness, a readily available market stockpile, and government advocacy and policies. For respiratory diseases caused by a rival agent through aerosol and droplet transmission routes, wearing masks could be a reasonable NPI to reduce the virus transmission efficiency and secondary transmission [5, 89]. \\nHowever, masks do not replace social distancing and other personal hygiene practices, such as hand washing. The effectiveness of any NPIs depends on compliance rates, contact rate reduction, the role of children, and asymptomatic cases in transmission. Our model analyzes the impact of wearing a mask that can efficiently filter viral aerosols during the COVID-19 pandemic in the general population. Our study suggests that wearing a quality mask in combination with other NPIs can support hospital resource management during a pandemic. In a free market, the risks of not having enough masks for the general population may negatively impact timely responses to the outbreak. Appropriate public health policies and government subsidies could be necessary to manage similar crises in the future. Future studies on how to improve adherence and compliance rates will better position society for potential future respiratory disease outbreaks when the viral agent has a similar clinical attack rate. - 1.

Furthermore, the widespread use of disposable masks has led to shortage of filter materials and problems with their haphazard disposal. In this study, a testing system that is based on standardized methods has been established and enhanced to reliably measure the particle filtration efficiency (PFE) of masks. Quality control experiments that examine the filtration efficiency of polystyrene latex (PSL) particles that are 0.1 µm in size and sodium chloride (NaCl) particles that range from 0.01–1.0 µm are conducted to determine the reliability of the testing system. Moreover, various textile materials are tested to fabricate 3-layer face masks, and the PFE of these masks is tested by using the proposed testing system to find the most suitable materials and the likelihood of their reusability. Among the tested materials, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) used as the membrane in the filter layer has the highest PFE of 88.33% ± 1.80%, which is mainly due to its dense and multilayer structure. The air permeability of the self-developed masks ranges from 1.41 ± 0.04 to 1.93 ± 0.08, less breathable than the commercial masks. The reusability of a mask that uses PTFE as the membrane in the filter layer is tested by gently washing the mask 30 times and then drying the mask in air before the PFE is measured. The PFE is only reduced by 10–20% after 30 washes, thus indicating the potential reusability of the mask. The findings in this study will contribute to reducing the pressure of mask shortages and are an environmentally friendly solution to the massive use of disposable masks. Keywords: COVID-19; Mask testing system; Reusable mask; Particle filtration efficiency. The new coronavirus (COVID-19) has become a global public health concern because it is highly contagious with severe or even fatal health consequences. With the rapid spread of COVID-19, self-protection has become crucial to avoid contracting this disease. \\nAs a highly infectious disease, the two main routes of transmission include direct transmission (e.g., spraying droplets emitted from aerosolized particles through sneezing, coughing or talking), and indirect transmission (contact with surfaces that contain the virus or objects that have been in contact with an infected individual) (Liu, 2020; Ningthoujam, 2020; Tomar and Gupta, 2020). However, the former has been documented to be a more prevalent form of transmission, so an effective mask must be worn to obstruct the transmission of the virus and block its spread when conducting daily life activities (Bałazy et al., 2006; MacIntyre and Chughtai, 2020). This has led to the unprecedented demand and shortage of masks, along with the problem of ineffective masks. On the one hand, there are a variety of different masks on the market. Although most commercially available masks claim effectiveness against contact with airborne particles, their actual performance has not been tested adequately. For example, Cheng (2020) reported that there was no quality control in face mask production in Pakistan. In Italy, in order to meet the huge demand of face masks, some industries have reset the production chain, shifting from the usual target products to the production of masks. However, the quality of the masks is questionable and needs to be tested (Amendola et al., 2020). In addition, Lam et al. (2020) examined 160 mask brands on the market and found that 48.8% of them were substandard and/or invalid. With COVID-19 as an urgent public health issue now, it has become imperative to test and validate the performance of these masks with reliable testing equipment. On the other hand, COVID-19 has led to the unprecedented demand for masks, which has resulted in a shortage of materials to fabricate them. Moreover, most of the masks currently found on the market are disposable (i.e., surgical, N95 and KF94 masks). \\nThe widespread use of such disposable masks is having a detrimental effect on the environment, as additional resources and human resources are needed to properly dispose of used masks which might otherwise end up in the oceans or landfills. As such, it is timely to develop effective yet reusable masks, not only to address the needs of the current epidemic but also to conserve resources. One of the key parameters of masks is their particle filtration efficiency (PFE) which reflects the ability of masks and/or filters to block the inhalation of different types of particles. Basically, PFE testing follows the methods stipulated in various standards, which include ASTM F2299 (the United States) and YY 0469-2011/GB19083-2010 (Chinese), and the standard provided by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). In ASTM F2299, polystyrene latex (PSL) particles of a specific size are used to evaluate the PFE of a material. Although the applicable particle size range is from 0.1 µm to 5.0 µm, PSL particles of 0.1 µm are generally used for testing as it is the most penetrating particle size. In YY 0469-2011, sodium chloride (NaCl) particles that range from 0.01 µm to 1.0 µm are used as the index in PFE testing of masks, while the NIOSH standard is used to test masks to filter NaCl particles that are 0.3 µm in size. Although these standard methods provide basic instructions and parameters for PFE testing, they do not offer specific settings for testing systems and details of the equipment involved. Moreover, some of the standard methods have limitations. For instance, a device that is recommended for measuring particle concentration (an optical particle counter (OPC)) is low in accuracy and size-resolution (Rengasamy et al., 2011). Moreover, the standards do not strictly stipulate the size of the particles to be tested, thus resulting in differences and uncertainties in the results with the different testing agents and systems.

The impact of this breakthrough seems almost too good to be true. We have found a disease control tool that, when used properly, can dramatically reduce the person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Studies have shown that this tool could reduce transmission by somewhere between 50% and 85%. The tool is cheap and remarkably low-tech. You can even make one at home. It has no significant side effects. And with each passing day, the scientific research showing the tool’s effectiveness gets stronger and stronger. If this tool were a vaccine or medicine, we’d be high-fiving each other and popping the champagne, knowing we’d discovered a crucial means to help prevent the spread of the pandemic. I’m talking, of course, about face masks—cloth, surgical, or even a bandanna. Face masks block the spread of respiratory droplets that can carry the novel coronavirus. But just as with so many other aspects of the response to COVID-19—including mass testing, contact tracing, and the early use of stay-at-home orders—the U.S. is once again squandering this opportunity. In many countries that have so far successfully controlled their COVID-19 epidemics, public health leaders, politicians, and the public have fully embraced the use of face masks with no hint of controversy. A recent study found that countries where masks were widely used soon after their COVID-19 outbreak began were more likely to keep their death rates low and to have a shorter outbreak. Countries like Hong Kong, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam that quickly adopted masking, along with other control measures such as social distancing and track and trace, have reported fewer than 6 deaths per million residents as a result of COVID-19. Yet in the U.S., where the death rate from COVID-19 is now 379 per million people, face masks have been weaponized for partisan purposes. \\nTaking their cues from President Trump, who has refused to appear on camera wearing a face mask and has said that Americans who wear masks are doing so to show their disapproval of him, many of his supporters now see wearing a face mask as an affront to personal liberty. According to the Washington Post, Republican leaders “are less likely to mandate them, and Republican voters are more likely to forgo, and even scorn, them.” Health officials who have promoted mask mandates have quit their jobs after receiving death threats. As a result of this alarming polarization, only 18 states and the District of Columbia are mandating face masks in public across the whole state. Only two—Massachusetts and Maryland—have Republican governors. Meanwhile, many Republican-led states are actively trying to subvert local measures. Nebraska Governor Pete Ricketts has gone so far as to say he will withhold federal coronavirus relief funds from local governments if they try and mandate mask use in their places of work. Rejecting face masks inevitably means embracing more COVID-19 cases and deaths. One U.S. study found that states with a mandate had a more rapid decline in daily growth rates of COVID-19 and estimated that mask use prevented up to 450,000 cases of COVID-19 by May 22, 2020. And while researchers at the University of Washington now predict that the U.S. could reach 180,000 COVID-19 deaths by October, they say we could prevent 33,000 of these deaths—more than half of the new deaths the model projects—if at least 95% of people wear a mask. That’s right. We can avert the deaths of 33,000 of our parents, grandparents, siblings, co-workers, teachers, bus drivers, mail carriers, nurses and store and factory workers by just sticking a one-dollar piece of cloth over our noses and mouths. So what’s stopping us? One problem is the “me first” culture in the U.S., in which anti-maskers claim that their right to go around unmasked in public matters more than saving lives.

Despite the current limited scientific data detailing their effectiveness, we support the wearing of face coverings by the public when mandated and when in close contact with people whose infection  status they don't know. However, we also encourage everyone to continue to limit their time spent  indoors near potentially infectious people and to not count on or expect a cloth mask or face  covering to protect them or the people around them. The pandemic is not over and will not likely be  over for some time. As states and local jurisdictions reopen, we encourage people to continue to  assess and limit their risks. Cloth masks and face coverings likely do not offer the same degree of  protection as physical distancing, isolation, or limiting personal contact time.  Will face coverings 'flatten the curve' and stop the pandemic?  We have reviewed the many modeling studies that purport to demonstrate that cloth masks or face  coverings have the potential for flattening the curve or significantly decrease the number of cases. These studies fail to recognize several important facts:  • The filter performance of a cloth material does not directly translate or represent its performance on an individual, because it neglects the understanding of fit.  • Cloth masks or coverings come in a variety of shapes, sizes, and materials and are not made  • Transmission is not simply a function of short random interactions between individuals, but  rather a function of particle concentration in the air and the time exposed to that concentration.  • A cloth mask or face covering does very little to prevent the emission or inhalation of small  particles. As discussed in an earlier CIDRAP commenta1y_(http, ://www.cidrap.umn.edu/n ws- perspective/2.020/03/commentary-covid-19-transmission-messages-should-l1inge-science)_and more recently by \\nMorawska and Milton (2020) in an open letter to WHO signed by 239 scientists, inhalation of  https://www.cidrap. umn. ed u/news-perspective/2020/04/commenta ry-masks-all-covid-19-not-based-sound-data ? COMMENTARY: Masks-for-all for COVID-19 not based on sound data I CIDRAP  small infectious particles is not only biologically plausible, but the epidemiology supports it as an important mode of transmission for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.  In summary, though we support mask wearing by the general public, we continue to conclude that  cloth masks and face coverings are likely to have limited impact on lowering COVID-19  transmission, because they have minimal ability to prevent the emission of small particles, offer  limited personal protection with respect to small particle inhalation, and should not be  recommended as a replacement for physical distancing or reducing time in enclosed spaces with  many potentially infectious people. We are very concerned about messaging that suggests cloth  masks or face coverings can replace physical distancing. We also worry that the public doesn't  understand the limitations of cloth masks and face coverings when we observe how many people  wear their mask under their nose or even under their mouth, remove their masks when talking to  someone nearby, or fail to practice physical distancing when wearing a mask.

In one corner, we have scientists, epidemiologists, infectious-disease physicians, clinicians, engineers—many different experts in the medical community, that is—arguing that the spread of COVID-19 by aerosols (that is, tiny droplets that can remain airborne long enough to travel significantly farther than the six-foot separation we’ve been told to observe) is both real and dangerous. In the other, it’s the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO), which until veryrecently have allowed only that aerosol spread is possible, not necessarily likely. And while watching experts going against governmental agencies isn’t always riveting stuff, this particular battle is terribly important. It has significant implications for how we as a country handle this epidemic, and what decisions we make going forward—and those decisions need to be made sooner, not later. On some level, this is a discussion of droplets versus aerosols. You’ve probably heard plenty this year about droplets: they’re larger in size and may be exhaled by someone talking, shouting, singing, coughing or sneezing. These droplets don’t travel far and fall quickly to the ground, one reason why a “social distance” of roughly six feet is seen as a safe one.

By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today. Aerosols, on the other hand, are tiny by comparison, nearly 10,000 times smaller than a human hair. They’re spread at far greater distances—20 to 30 feet—and can linger in the air for minutes to hours, infecting others. What constitutes a safe distance from aerosols is much harder to define, especially in crowded indoor spaces with poor ventilation. \\nChoosing a safe mask becomes difficult as well: an N95 respirator, for example, would be preferable to an ill-fitting cloth mask when it comes to filtering out these minuscule viral aerosols. For these and other reasons, some in the medical community suspect, our health agencies have been reluctant to accept the data on the airborne transmission of COVID-19—because if they do, they’re acknowledging a problem far more challenging even than what we’ve been dealt with so far. This reluctance has prompted an epic response. In a nearly unprecedented move, 239 scientists from 32 countries wrote an open letter to the WHO in July, urging the agency to recognize that airborne transmission of coronavirus by smaller aerosol particles is possible. The organization’s response was to subsequently update its position, stating that aerosol transmission “cannot be ruled out.” A glowing endorsement this was not—although, points out a spokesperson for the organization, “We have substantial guidance on the topic and speak repeatedly in press conferences and other venues about the importance of keeping indoor spaces well ventilated, precisely because of the potential of aerosol transmission in these settings. WHO has advice in the form of Q&As for the general public, and for people who manage public spaces and buildings and health facilities.” The CDC, meanwhile, posted on its Web site over the weekend that aerosolization may be “the main way the virus spreads,” then backtracked and removed the content from its site, claiming the language had been a draft of some proposed changes which were “posted in error.” This is a major point, not a minor one. Aerosol carry of the virus means that any indoor area where people gather in numbers—think restaurants, bars, churches, schools, rallies—is potentially a spreader of the disease, and depending upon the numbers, a superspreader. These are likely places with poor ventilation, where people not only are close together but may be speaking loudly, shouting, singing, cheering or booing, etc. \\nThe idea of aerosol spread is neither new nor controversial. Several diseases, including measles, chickenpox and tuberculosis, have been shown to be transmitted by aerosols. Patients sick with the flu have the virus in their exhaled breath, and that virus has been shown to be present in the air. This is true for some other viruses, including those found in infants. Scientists in Wuhan, China, have identified coronavirus RNA particles in the air in hospital areas, although they haven’t yet proven that the particles are infectious. Lab workers at the University of Nebraska have published their finding that they, too, have identified coronavirus RNA in the air. “We have pretty strong circumstantial evidence, in a number of these superspreading indoor incidents, that there must have been a significant component of aerosol or airborne transmission,” says William Bahnfleth, chair of the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) Epidemic Task Force. Bahnfleth noted several examples, including a restaurant in Guangzhou, China, where multiple people without direct contact with one another became infected from a single individual, and a choir practice in Washington state where presumed droplet and aerosol spread from singingsickened 53 people, two of whom died. In an e-mail interview, researcher Bjorn Birnir shared his work, published in a preprint (a non–peer reviewed paper), that demonstrated how an infected person continues to exhale a cloud of droplets and aerosols. These “build up over time to dangerous concentrations for everyone in the room,” Birnir says. While we don’t know exactly how much virus is needed to infect people or at what concentrations, these examples show that at some point the threshold is met and inhaled aerosols are the likely culprits. “Aerosol transmission plays a significant role in indoor environments and cannot be neglected,” says environmental science expert Maosheng Yao, a professor of engineering at Peking University. \"), Evidence(question='What are the limitations of cloth masks in preventing COVID-19 transmission?', answer='Cloth masks have minimal ability to prevent the emission or inhalation of small particles and should not replace physical distancing.', url='https://aaqr.org/articles/aaqr-20-06-covid-0275', scraped_text='The unprecedented demand for masks has now attracted attention on their filtration efficiency.

Keywords: COVID-19; Mask testing system; Reusable mask; Particle filtration efficiency. The new coronavirus (COVID-19) has become a global public health concern because it is highly contagious with severe or even fatal health consequences. With the rapid spread of COVID-19, self-protection has become crucial to avoid contracting this disease. \\nAs a highly infectious disease, the two main routes of transmission include direct transmission (e.g., spraying droplets emitted from aerosolized particles through sneezing, coughing or talking), and indirect transmission (contact with surfaces that contain the virus or objects that have been in contact with an infected individual) (Liu, 2020; Ningthoujam, 2020; Tomar and Gupta, 2020). However, the former has been documented to be a more prevalent form of transmission, so an effective mask must be worn to obstruct the transmission of the virus and block its spread when conducting daily life activities (Bałazy et al., 2006; MacIntyre and Chughtai, 2020). This has led to the unprecedented demand and shortage of masks, along with the problem of ineffective masks. On the one hand, there are a variety of different masks on the market. Although most commercially available masks claim effectiveness against contact with airborne particles, their actual performance has not been tested adequately. For example, Cheng (2020) reported that there was no quality control in face mask production in Pakistan. In Italy, in order to meet the huge demand of face masks, some industries have reset the production chain, shifting from the usual target products to the production of masks. However, the quality of the masks is questionable and needs to be tested (Amendola et al., 2020). In addition, Lam et al. (2020) examined 160 mask brands on the market and found that 48.8% of them were substandard and/or invalid. With COVID-19 as an urgent public health issue now, it has become imperative to test and validate the performance of these masks with reliable testing equipment. On the other hand, COVID-19 has led to the unprecedented demand for masks, which has resulted in a shortage of materials to fabricate them. Moreover, most of the masks currently found on the market are disposable (i.e., surgical, N95 and KF94 masks). \\nThe widespread use of such disposable masks is having a detrimental effect on the environment, as additional resources and human resources are needed to properly dispose of used masks which might otherwise end up in the oceans or landfills. As such, it is timely to develop effective yet reusable masks, not only to address the needs of the current epidemic but also to conserve resources. One of the key parameters of masks is their particle filtration efficiency (PFE) which reflects the ability of masks and/or filters to block the inhalation of different types of particles. Basically, PFE testing follows the methods stipulated in various standards, which include ASTM F2299 (the United States) and YY 0469-2011/GB19083-2010 (Chinese), and the standard provided by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). In ASTM F2299, polystyrene latex (PSL) particles of a specific size are used to evaluate the PFE of a material. Although the applicable particle size range is from 0.1 µm to 5.0 µm, PSL particles of 0.1 µm are generally used for testing as it is the most penetrating particle size. In YY 0469-2011, sodium chloride (NaCl) particles that range from 0.01 µm to 1.0 µm are used as the index in PFE testing of masks, while the NIOSH standard is used to test masks to filter NaCl particles that are 0.3 µm in size. Although these standard methods provide basic instructions and parameters for PFE testing, they do not offer specific settings for testing systems and details of the equipment involved. Moreover, some of the standard methods have limitations. For instance, a device that is recommended for measuring particle concentration (an optical particle counter (OPC)) is low in accuracy and size-resolution (Rengasamy et al., 2011). Moreover, the standards do not strictly stipulate the size of the particles to be tested, thus resulting in differences and uncertainties in the results with the different testing agents and systems.

ANOVA analysis is used to analyze the group effect. The p value is less than 2e-16 for the log 2 transformed case comparison, suggesting that the two groups are statistically significantly different. The Asian mask-wearing group clearly has lower growth rates of COVID-19 cases compared to the non-mask-wearing group. Thailand has the highest growth rate among the mask-wearing groups. However, the differences in the growth rate of confirmed cases between these two groups cannot be fully attributed to mask-wearing, but arise from many factors, such as clinical tests performed, complicated social, economic, and cultural differences, and varied public health polices enforcement. The preliminary comparison only provides the rationale to further evaluate if wearing masks is effective for controlling the infectious disease outbreak. Our study has six major assumptions with preliminary evidence. First, the SARS-CoV-2 transmission pathway includes airborne [1, 8, 22–24] with an R0 value exceeding that of influenza and SARS [16, 32, 33]. Second, a proportion of infected cases could be asymptomatic [36, 38, 46, 47]. Third, asymptomatic individuals could transfer the virus in the community [48, 49, 82]. Fourth, the public awareness of mask usage may increase as the pandemic spreads [64]. Fifth, the market could respond to consumer demand with a production increase and without supply chain problems [67]. Sixth, homemade cloth masks are not as effective as commercial medical masks [57, 60]. Thus, we project the best scenario as the pandemic spreads and by the end of the outbreak, the general population will be willing to wear a mask. Although wearing a mask is a low-cost and non-disruptive measure, wearing a mask has not been culturally widespread in many parts of the world [83]. Furthermore, for non-certified medical masks, individual errors could lead to ineffective mask fitting, which could reduce the benefit of wearing a mask [84]. \\nThere are limitations to those six assumptions. First, a recent study suggested that the virus was detected on the outer layer of COVID-19 patients' masks [85], which could invalidate the utility of a patient wearing a mask. However, although the virus was detected, the mask could still provide prevention by reducing the virus load to an adjacent healthy individual. Further studies on asymptomatic individuals wearing masks could be more convincing to validate the effectiveness of wearing a mask to prevent pre-symptomatic transmission. Second, we assume random mixing and model the general population, but have not taken account children's role. Children are less likely to wear masks consistently to realize mask effectiveness. At the same time, the role of children in COVID-19 transmission is unclear [86]. Third, we assume the willing individual who has a mask can use the mask in the right manner and follow social distancing and other personal hygiene practices. There are discrepancies between willingness, perceived compliance, and real compliance [87]. Fourth, research shows that masks can be a source of contamination if not disposed of or replaced in timely manner The COVID-19 pandemic has created a global crisis. Prevention such as vaccines is one of the most effective measures to mitigate such a catastrophic public health crisis. Prior to an available vaccine, NPIs such as wearing a mask can potentially reduce the virus transmission rate. Recent modeling studies suggest that timely and comprehensive NPIs are needed to prevent a secondary wave of COVID-19 [89]. However, timely implementations of NPI such as wearing a mask call for public awareness, a readily available market stockpile, and government advocacy and policies. For respiratory diseases caused by a rival agent through aerosol and droplet transmission routes, wearing masks could be a reasonable NPI to reduce the virus transmission efficiency and secondary transmission [5, 89]. \\nHowever, masks do not replace social distancing and other personal hygiene practices, such as hand washing. The effectiveness of any NPIs depends on compliance rates, contact rate reduction, the role of children, and asymptomatic cases in transmission. Our model analyzes the impact of wearing a mask that can efficiently filter viral aerosols during the COVID-19 pandemic in the general population. Our study suggests that wearing a quality mask in combination with other NPIs can support hospital resource management during a pandemic. In a free market, the risks of not having enough masks for the general population may negatively impact timely responses to the outbreak. Appropriate public health policies and government subsidies could be necessary to manage similar crises in the future. Future studies on how to improve adherence and compliance rates will better position society for potential future respiratory disease outbreaks when the viral agent has a similar clinical attack rate. - 1.

Despite the current limited scientific data detailing their effectiveness, we support the wearing of face coverings by the public when mandated and when in close contact with people whose infection  status they don't know. However, we also encourage everyone to continue to limit their time spent  indoors near potentially infectious people and to not count on or expect a cloth mask or face  covering to protect them or the people around them. The pandemic is not over and will not likely be  over for some time. As states and local jurisdictions reopen, we encourage people to continue to  assess and limit their risks. Cloth masks and face coverings likely do not offer the same degree of  protection as physical distancing, isolation, or limiting personal contact time.  Will face coverings 'flatten the curve' and stop the pandemic?  We have reviewed the many modeling studies that purport to demonstrate that cloth masks or face  coverings have the potential for flattening the curve or significantly decrease the number of cases. These studies fail to recognize several important facts:  • The filter performance of a cloth material does not directly translate or represent its performance on an individual, because it neglects the understanding of fit.  • Cloth masks or coverings come in a variety of shapes, sizes, and materials and are not made  • Transmission is not simply a function of short random interactions between individuals, but  rather a function of particle concentration in the air and the time exposed to that concentration.  • A cloth mask or face covering does very little to prevent the emission or inhalation of small  particles.

In summary, though we support mask wearing by the general public, we continue to conclude that  cloth masks and face coverings are likely to have limited impact on lowering COVID-19  transmission, because they have minimal ability to prevent the emission of small particles, offer  limited personal protection with respect to small particle inhalation, and should not be  recommended as a replacement for physical distancing or reducing time in enclosed spaces with  many potentially infectious people. We are very concerned about messaging that suggests cloth  masks or face coverings can replace physical distancing. We also worry that the public doesn't  understand the limitations of cloth masks and face coverings when we observe how many people  wear their mask under their nose or even under their mouth, remove their masks when talking to  someone nearby, or fail to practice physical distancing when wearing a mask.

In one corner, we have scientists, epidemiologists, infectious-disease physicians, clinicians, engineers—many different experts in the medical community, that is—arguing that the spread of COVID-19 by aerosols (that is, tiny droplets that can remain airborne long enough to travel significantly farther than the six-foot separation we’ve been told to observe) is both real and dangerous. In the other, it’s the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO), which until veryrecently have allowed only that aerosol spread is possible, not necessarily likely. And while watching experts going against governmental agencies isn’t always riveting stuff, this particular battle is terribly important. It has significant implications for how we as a country handle this epidemic, and what decisions we make going forward—and those decisions need to be made sooner, not later. On some level, this is a discussion of droplets versus aerosols. You’ve probably heard plenty this year about droplets: they’re larger in size and may be exhaled by someone talking, shouting, singing, coughing or sneezing. These droplets don’t travel far and fall quickly to the ground, one reason why a “social distance” of roughly six feet is seen as a safe one.

By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today. Aerosols, on the other hand, are tiny by comparison, nearly 10,000 times smaller than a human hair. They’re spread at far greater distances—20 to 30 feet—and can linger in the air for minutes to hours, infecting others. What constitutes a safe distance from aerosols is much harder to define, especially in crowded indoor spaces with poor ventilation. \\nChoosing a safe mask becomes difficult as well: an N95 respirator, for example, would be preferable to an ill-fitting cloth mask when it comes to filtering out these minuscule viral aerosols. For these and other reasons, some in the medical community suspect, our health agencies have been reluctant to accept the data on the airborne transmission of COVID-19—because if they do, they’re acknowledging a problem far more challenging even than what we’ve been dealt with so far. This reluctance has prompted an epic response. In a nearly unprecedented move, 239 scientists from 32 countries wrote an open letter to the WHO in July, urging the agency to recognize that airborne transmission of coronavirus by smaller aerosol particles is possible. The organization’s response was to subsequently update its position, stating that aerosol transmission “cannot be ruled out.” A glowing endorsement this was not—although, points out a spokesperson for the organization, “We have substantial guidance on the topic and speak repeatedly in press conferences and other venues about the importance of keeping indoor spaces well ventilated, precisely because of the potential of aerosol transmission in these settings. WHO has advice in the form of Q&As for the general public, and for people who manage public spaces and buildings and health facilities.” The CDC, meanwhile, posted on its Web site over the weekend that aerosolization may be “the main way the virus spreads,” then backtracked and removed the content from its site, claiming the language had been a draft of some proposed changes which were “posted in error.” This is a major point, not a minor one. Aerosol carry of the virus means that any indoor area where people gather in numbers—think restaurants, bars, churches, schools, rallies—is potentially a spreader of the disease, and depending upon the numbers, a superspreader. These are likely places with poor ventilation, where people not only are close together but may be speaking loudly, shouting, singing, cheering or booing, etc. \\nThe idea of aerosol spread is neither new nor controversial. Several diseases, including measles, chickenpox and tuberculosis, have been shown to be transmitted by aerosols. Patients sick with the flu have the virus in their exhaled breath, and that virus has been shown to be present in the air. This is true for some other viruses, including those found in infants. Scientists in Wuhan, China, have identified coronavirus RNA particles in the air in hospital areas, although they haven’t yet proven that the particles are infectious. Lab workers at the University of Nebraska have published their finding that they, too, have identified coronavirus RNA in the air. “We have pretty strong circumstantial evidence, in a number of these superspreading indoor incidents, that there must have been a significant component of aerosol or airborne transmission,” says William Bahnfleth, chair of the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) Epidemic Task Force. Bahnfleth noted several examples, including a restaurant in Guangzhou, China, where multiple people without direct contact with one another became infected from a single individual, and a choir practice in Washington state where presumed droplet and aerosol spread from singingsickened 53 people, two of whom died. In an e-mail interview, researcher Bjorn Birnir shared his work, published in a preprint (a non–peer reviewed paper), that demonstrated how an infected person continues to exhale a cloud of droplets and aerosols. These “build up over time to dangerous concentrations for everyone in the room,” Birnir says. While we don’t know exactly how much virus is needed to infect people or at what concentrations, these examples show that at some point the threshold is met and inhaled aerosols are the likely culprits. “Aerosol transmission plays a significant role in indoor environments and cannot be neglected,” says environmental science expert Maosheng Yao, a professor of engineering at Peking University. \")], metadata={'suggested_label': array([0.3994863 , 0.05406459, 0.1469628 , 0.3994863 ]), 'llm_type': 'gpt-4o', 'llm_output': {'questions': [{'question': 'What is the effectiveness of masks in blocking respiratory droplets that can carry the novel coronavirus?', 'answer': 'Face masks can dramatically reduce the person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by blocking respiratory droplets.', 'source': '4'}, {'question': 'Do cloth masks offer the same degree of protection as physical distancing?', 'answer': 'Cloth masks likely do not offer the same degree of protection as physical distancing, isolation, or limiting personal contact time.', 'source': '1'}, {'question': 'What is the particle filtration efficiency (PFE) of masks using PTFE as the membrane in the filter layer?', 'answer': 'The PFE of masks using PTFE as the membrane in the filter layer is 88.33% ± 1.80%.', 'source': '0'}, {'question': 'What is the stance of the CDC and WHO on aerosol transmission of COVID-19?', 'answer': 'The CDC and WHO have acknowledged that aerosol transmission is possible but have been reluctant to fully accept it as a significant mode of transmission.', 'source': '2'}, {'question': 'What is the impact of mask-wearing on the growth rate of COVID-19 cases in mask-wearing versus non-mask-wearing groups?', 'answer': 'The Asian mask-wearing group has lower growth rates of COVID-19 cases compared to the non-mask-wearing group.', 'source': '3'}, {'question': 'What are the limitations of cloth masks in preventing COVID-19 transmission?', 'answer': 'Cloth masks have minimal ability to prevent the emission or inhalation of small particles and should not replace physical distancing.', 'source': '1'}, {'question': 'What is the potential reduction in COVID-19 transmission with proper mask usage?', 'answer': 'Proper mask usage could reduce COVID-19 transmission by somewhere between 50% and 85%.', 'source': '4'}, {'question': \"What are the concerns about the public's understanding of the effectiveness of cloth masks?\", 'answer': 'There is concern that the public does not understand the limitations of cloth masks, such as their minimal ability to prevent the emission or inhalation of small particles.', 'source': '1'}, {'question': 'What is the role of aerosols in the transmission of COVID-19?', 'answer': 'Aerosols can linger in the air for minutes to hours and infect others, making them a significant mode of transmission in crowded indoor spaces with poor ventilation.', 'source': '2'}, {'question': 'What is the effectiveness of homemade cloth masks compared to commercial medical masks?', 'answer': 'Homemade cloth masks are not as effective as commercial medical masks.', 'source': '3'}], 'claim_veracity': {'Supported': '2', 'Refuted': '4', 'Not Enough Evidence': '3', 'Conflicting Evidence/Cherrypicking': '4'}}}), retrieval_result=RetrievalResult(documents=[Document(metadata={'url': 'https://aaqr.org/articles/aaqr-20-06-covid-0275', 'context_before': 'The unprecedented demand for masks has now attracted attention on their filtration efficiency. Furthermore, the widespread use of disposable masks has led to shortage of filter materials and problems with their haphazard disposal. In this study, a testing system that is based on standardized methods has been established and enhanced to reliably measure the particle filtration efficiency (PFE) of masks. Quality control experiments that examine the filtration efficiency of polystyrene latex (PSL) particles that are 0.1 µm in size and sodium chloride (NaCl) particles that range from 0.01–1.0 µm are conducted to determine the reliability of the testing system. Moreover, various textile materials are tested to fabricate 3-layer face masks, and the PFE of these masks is tested by using the proposed testing system to find the most suitable materials and the likelihood of their reusability. Among the tested materials, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) used as the membrane in the filter layer has the highest PFE of 88.33% ± 1.80%, which is mainly due to its dense and multilayer structure. The air permeability of the self-developed masks ranges from 1.41 ± 0.04 to 1.93 ± 0.08, less breathable than the commercial masks. The reusability of a mask that uses PTFE as the membrane in the filter layer is tested by gently washing the mask 30 times and then drying the mask in air before the PFE is measured. The PFE is only reduced by 10–20% after 30 washes, thus indicating the potential reusability of the mask. The findings in this study will contribute to reducing the pressure of mask shortages and are an environmentally friendly solution to the massive use of disposable masks. Keywords: COVID-19; Mask testing system; Reusable mask; Particle filtration efficiency. The new coronavirus (COVID-19) has become a global public health concern because it is highly contagious with severe or even fatal health consequences. With the rapid spread of COVID-19, self-protection has become crucial to avoid contracting this disease. ', 'context_after': 'The widespread use of such disposable masks is having a detrimental effect on the environment, as additional resources and human resources are needed to properly dispose of used masks which might otherwise end up in the oceans or landfills. As such, it is timely to develop effective yet reusable masks, not only to address the needs of the current epidemic but also to conserve resources. One of the key parameters of masks is their particle filtration efficiency (PFE) which reflects the ability of masks and/or filters to block the inhalation of different types of particles. Basically, PFE testing follows the methods stipulated in various standards, which include ASTM F2299 (the United States) and YY 0469-2011/GB19083-2010 (Chinese), and the standard provided by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). In ASTM F2299, polystyrene latex (PSL) particles of a specific size are used to evaluate the PFE of a material. Although the applicable particle size range is from 0.1 µm to 5.0 µm, PSL particles of 0.1 µm are generally used for testing as it is the most penetrating particle size. In YY 0469-2011, sodium chloride (NaCl) particles that range from 0.01 µm to 1.0 µm are used as the index in PFE testing of masks, while the NIOSH standard is used to test masks to filter NaCl particles that are 0.3 µm in size. Although these standard methods provide basic instructions and parameters for PFE testing, they do not offer specific settings for testing systems and details of the equipment involved. Moreover, some of the standard methods have limitations. For instance, a device that is recommended for measuring particle concentration (an optical particle counter (OPC)) is low in accuracy and size-resolution (Rengasamy et al., 2011). Moreover, the standards do not strictly stipulate the size of the particles to be tested, thus resulting in differences and uncertainties in the results with the different testing agents and systems. '}, page_content='As a highly infectious disease, the two main routes of transmission include direct transmission (e.g., spraying droplets emitted from aerosolized particles through sneezing, coughing or talking), and indirect transmission (contact with surfaces that contain the virus or objects that have been in contact with an infected individual) (Liu, 2020; Ningthoujam, 2020; Tomar and Gupta, 2020). However, the former has been documented to be a more prevalent form of transmission, so an effective mask must be worn to obstruct the transmission of the virus and block its spread when conducting daily life activities (Bałazy et al., 2006; MacIntyre and Chughtai, 2020). This has led to the unprecedented demand and shortage of masks, along with the problem of ineffective masks. On the one hand, there are a variety of different masks on the market. Although most commercially available masks claim effectiveness against contact with airborne particles, their actual performance has not been tested adequately. For example, Cheng (2020) reported that there was no quality control in face mask production in Pakistan. In Italy, in order to meet the huge demand of face masks, some industries have reset the production chain, shifting from the usual target products to the production of masks. However, the quality of the masks is questionable and needs to be tested (Amendola et al., 2020). In addition, Lam et al. (2020) examined 160 mask brands on the market and found that 48.8% of them were substandard and/or invalid. With COVID-19 as an urgent public health issue now, it has become imperative to test and validate the performance of these masks with reliable testing equipment. On the other hand, COVID-19 has led to the unprecedented demand for masks, which has resulted in a shortage of materials to fabricate them. Moreover, most of the masks currently found on the market are disposable (i.e., surgical, N95 and KF94 masks).

Despite the current limited scientific data detailing their effectiveness, we support the wearing of face coverings by the public when mandated and when in close contact with people whose infection  status they don't know. However, we also encourage everyone to continue to limit their time spent  indoors near potentially infectious people and to not count on or expect a cloth mask or face  covering to protect them or the people around them. The pandemic is not over and will not likely be  over for some time. As states and local jurisdictions reopen, we encourage people to continue to  assess and limit their risks. Cloth masks and face coverings likely do not offer the same degree of  protection as physical distancing, isolation, or limiting personal contact time.  Will face coverings 'flatten the curve' and stop the pandemic?  We have reviewed the many modeling studies that purport to demonstrate that cloth masks or face  coverings have the potential for flattening the curve or significantly decrease the number of cases. These studies fail to recognize several important facts:  • The filter performance of a cloth material does not directly translate or represent its performance on an individual, because it neglects the understanding of fit.  • Cloth masks or coverings come in a variety of shapes, sizes, and materials and are not made  • Transmission is not simply a function of short random interactions between individuals, but  rather a function of particle concentration in the air and the time exposed to that concentration.  • A cloth mask or face covering does very little to prevent the emission or inhalation of small  particles.

In summary, though we support mask wearing by the general public, we continue to conclude that  cloth masks and face coverings are likely to have limited impact on lowering COVID-19  transmission, because they have minimal ability to prevent the emission of small particles, offer  limited personal protection with respect to small particle inhalation, and should not be  recommended as a replacement for physical distancing or reducing time in enclosed spaces with  many potentially infectious people. We are very concerned about messaging that suggests cloth  masks or face coverings can replace physical distancing. We also worry that the public doesn't  understand the limitations of cloth masks and face coverings when we observe how many people  wear their mask under their nose or even under their mouth, remove their masks when talking to  someone nearby, or fail to practice physical distancing when wearing a mask.

In one corner, we have scientists, epidemiologists, infectious-disease physicians, clinicians, engineers—many different experts in the medical community, that is—arguing that the spread of COVID-19 by aerosols (that is, tiny droplets that can remain airborne long enough to travel significantly farther than the six-foot separation we’ve been told to observe) is both real and dangerous. In the other, it’s the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO), which until veryrecently have allowed only that aerosol spread is possible, not necessarily likely. And while watching experts going against governmental agencies isn’t always riveting stuff, this particular battle is terribly important. It has significant implications for how we as a country handle this epidemic, and what decisions we make going forward—and those decisions need to be made sooner, not later. On some level, this is a discussion of droplets versus aerosols. You’ve probably heard plenty this year about droplets: they’re larger in size and may be exhaled by someone talking, shouting, singing, coughing or sneezing. These droplets don’t travel far and fall quickly to the ground, one reason why a “social distance” of roughly six feet is seen as a safe one.

Aerosols, on the other hand, are tiny by comparison, nearly 10,000 times smaller than a human hair. They’re spread at far greater distances—20 to 30 feet—and can linger in the air for minutes to hours, infecting others. What constitutes a safe distance from aerosols is much harder to define, especially in crowded indoor spaces with poor ventilation. \", 'context_after': 'The idea of aerosol spread is neither new nor controversial. Several diseases, including measles, chickenpox and tuberculosis, have been shown to be transmitted by aerosols. Patients sick with the flu have the virus in their exhaled breath, and that virus has been shown to be present in the air. This is true for some other viruses, including those found in infants. Scientists in Wuhan, China, have identified coronavirus RNA particles in the air in hospital areas, although they haven’t yet proven that the particles are infectious. Lab workers at the University of Nebraska have published their finding that they, too, have identified coronavirus RNA in the air. “We have pretty strong circumstantial evidence, in a number of these superspreading indoor incidents, that there must have been a significant component of aerosol or airborne transmission,” says William Bahnfleth, chair of the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) Epidemic Task Force. Bahnfleth noted several examples, including a restaurant in Guangzhou, China, where multiple people without direct contact with one another became infected from a single individual, and a choir practice in Washington state where presumed droplet and aerosol spread from singingsickened 53 people, two of whom died. In an e-mail interview, researcher Bjorn Birnir shared his work, published in a preprint (a non–peer reviewed paper), that demonstrated how an infected person continues to exhale a cloud of droplets and aerosols.

'}, page_content='Choosing a safe mask becomes difficult as well: an N95 respirator, for example, would be preferable to an ill-fitting cloth mask when it comes to filtering out these minuscule viral aerosols. For these and other reasons, some in the medical community suspect, our health agencies have been reluctant to accept the data on the airborne transmission of COVID-19—because if they do, they’re acknowledging a problem far more challenging even than what we’ve been dealt with so far. This reluctance has prompted an epic response. In a nearly unprecedented move, 239 scientists from 32 countries wrote an open letter to the WHO in July, urging the agency to recognize that airborne transmission of coronavirus by smaller aerosol particles is possible. The organization’s response was to subsequently update its position, stating that aerosol transmission “cannot be ruled out.” A glowing endorsement this was not—although, points out a spokesperson for the organization, “We have substantial guidance on the topic and speak repeatedly in press conferences and other venues about the importance of keeping indoor spaces well ventilated, precisely because of the potential of aerosol transmission in these settings. WHO has advice in the form of Q&As for the general public, and for people who manage public spaces and buildings and health facilities.” The CDC, meanwhile, posted on its Web site over the weekend that aerosolization may be “the main way the virus spreads,” then backtracked and removed the content from its site, claiming the language had been a draft of some proposed changes which were “posted in error.” This is a major point, not a minor one. Aerosol carry of the virus means that any indoor area where people gather in numbers—think restaurants, bars, churches, schools, rallies—is potentially a spreader of the disease, and depending upon the numbers, a superspreader. These are likely places with poor ventilation, where people not only are close together but may be speaking loudly, shouting, singing, cheering or booing, etc. '), Document(metadata={'url': 'https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0237691', 'context_before': 'A log transformed analysis is conducted to evaluate the growth rate of COVID-19 infections. ANOVA analysis is used to analyze the group effect. The p value is less than 2e-16 for the log 2 transformed case comparison, suggesting that the two groups are statistically significantly different. The Asian mask-wearing group clearly has lower growth rates of COVID-19 cases compared to the non-mask-wearing group. Thailand has the highest growth rate among the mask-wearing groups. However, the differences in the growth rate of confirmed cases between these two groups cannot be fully attributed to mask-wearing, but arise from many factors, such as clinical tests performed, complicated social, economic, and cultural differences, and varied public health polices enforcement. The preliminary comparison only provides the rationale to further evaluate if wearing masks is effective for controlling the infectious disease outbreak. Our study has six major assumptions with preliminary evidence. First, the SARS-CoV-2 transmission pathway includes airborne [1, 8, 22–24] with an R0 value exceeding that of influenza and SARS [16, 32, 33]. Second, a proportion of infected cases could be asymptomatic [36, 38, 46, 47]. Third, asymptomatic individuals could transfer the virus in the community [48, 49, 82]. Fourth, the public awareness of mask usage may increase as the pandemic spreads [64]. Fifth, the market could respond to consumer demand with a production increase and without supply chain problems [67]. Sixth, homemade cloth masks are not as effective as commercial medical masks [57, 60]. Thus, we project the best scenario as the pandemic spreads and by the end of the outbreak, the general population will be willing to wear a mask. Although wearing a mask is a low-cost and non-disruptive measure, wearing a mask has not been culturally widespread in many parts of the world [83]. Furthermore, for non-certified medical masks, individual errors could lead to ineffective mask fitting, which could reduce the benefit of wearing a mask [84]. ', 'context_after': 'However, masks do not replace social distancing and other personal hygiene practices, such as hand washing. The effectiveness of any NPIs depends on compliance rates, contact rate reduction, the role of children, and asymptomatic cases in transmission. Our model analyzes the impact of wearing a mask that can efficiently filter viral aerosols during the COVID-19 pandemic in the general population. Our study suggests that wearing a quality mask in combination with other NPIs can support hospital resource management during a pandemic. In a free market, the risks of not having enough masks for the general population may negatively impact timely responses to the outbreak. Appropriate public health policies and government subsidies could be necessary to manage similar crises in the future. Future studies on how to improve adherence and compliance rates will better position society for potential future respiratory disease outbreaks when the viral agent has a similar clinical attack rate. - 1.

First, a recent study suggested that the virus was detected on the outer layer of COVID-19 patients' masks [85], which could invalidate the utility of a patient wearing a mask. However, although the virus was detected, the mask could still provide prevention by reducing the virus load to an adjacent healthy individual. Further studies on asymptomatic individuals wearing masks could be more convincing to validate the effectiveness of wearing a mask to prevent pre-symptomatic transmission. Second, we assume random mixing and model the general population, but have not taken account children's role. Children are less likely to wear masks consistently to realize mask effectiveness. At the same time, the role of children in COVID-19 transmission is unclear [86]. Third, we assume the willing individual who has a mask can use the mask in the right manner and follow social distancing and other personal hygiene practices. There are discrepancies between willingness, perceived compliance, and real compliance [87]. Fourth, research shows that masks can be a source of contamination if not disposed of or replaced in timely manner The COVID-19 pandemic has created a global crisis. Prevention such as vaccines is one of the most effective measures to mitigate such a catastrophic public health crisis. Prior to an available vaccine, NPIs such as wearing a mask can potentially reduce the virus transmission rate. Recent modeling studies suggest that timely and comprehensive NPIs are needed to prevent a secondary wave of COVID-19 [89]. However, timely implementations of NPI such as wearing a mask call for public awareness, a readily available market stockpile, and government advocacy and policies. For respiratory diseases caused by a rival agent through aerosol and droplet transmission routes, wearing masks could be a reasonable NPI to reduce the virus transmission efficiency and secondary transmission [5, 89]. \"), Document(metadata={'url': 'https://time.com/5861295/masks-covid19-spread-fighting/', 'context_before': '', 'context_after': 'Taking their cues from President Trump, who has refused to appear on camera wearing a face mask and has said that Americans who wear masks are doing so to show their disapproval of him, many of his supporters now see wearing a face mask as an affront to personal liberty. According to the Washington Post, Republican leaders “are less likely to mandate them, and Republican voters are more likely to forgo, and even scorn, them.” Health officials who have promoted mask mandates have quit their jobs after receiving death threats. As a result of this alarming polarization, only 18 states and the District of Columbia are mandating face masks in public across the whole state. Only two—Massachusetts and Maryland—have Republican governors. Meanwhile, many Republican-led states are actively trying to subvert local measures. Nebraska Governor Pete Ricketts has gone so far as to say he will withhold federal coronavirus relief funds from local governments if they try and mandate mask use in their places of work. Rejecting face masks inevitably means embracing more COVID-19 cases and deaths. One U.S. study found that states with a mandate had a more rapid decline in daily growth rates of COVID-19 and estimated that mask use prevented up to 450,000 cases of COVID-19 by May 22, 2020. And while researchers at the University of Washington now predict that the U.S. could reach 180,000 COVID-19 deaths by October, they say we could prevent 33,000 of these deaths—more than half of the new deaths the model projects—if at least 95% of people wear a mask. That’s right. We can avert the deaths of 33,000 of our parents, grandparents, siblings, co-workers, teachers, bus drivers, mail carriers, nurses and store and factory workers by just sticking a one-dollar piece of cloth over our noses and mouths. So what’s stopping us? One problem is the “me first” culture in the U.S., in which anti-maskers claim that their right to go around unmasked in public matters more than saving lives. '}, page_content='At long last, we have made a truly game-changing scientific breakthrough in preventing the spread of COVID-19. The impact of this breakthrough seems almost too good to be true. We have found a disease control tool that, when used properly, can dramatically reduce the person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Studies have shown that this tool could reduce transmission by somewhere between 50% and 85%. The tool is cheap and remarkably low-tech. You can even make one at home. It has no significant side effects. And with each passing day, the scientific research showing the tool’s effectiveness gets stronger and stronger. If this tool were a vaccine or medicine, we’d be high-fiving each other and popping the champagne, knowing we’d discovered a crucial means to help prevent the spread of the pandemic. I’m talking, of course, about face masks—cloth, surgical, or even a bandanna. Face masks block the spread of respiratory droplets that can carry the novel coronavirus. But just as with so many other aspects of the response to COVID-19—including mass testing, contact tracing, and the early use of stay-at-home orders—the U.S. is once again squandering this opportunity. In many countries that have so far successfully controlled their COVID-19 epidemics, public health leaders, politicians, and the public have fully embraced the use of face masks with no hint of controversy. A recent study found that countries where masks were widely used soon after their COVID-19 outbreak began were more likely to keep their death rates low and to have a shorter outbreak. Countries like Hong Kong, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam that quickly adopted masking, along with other control measures such as social distancing and track and trace, have reported fewer than 6 deaths per million residents as a result of COVID-19.

       "   'scraped_text': \"A log transformed analysis is conducted to evaluate the growth rate of COVID-19 infections. ANOVA analysis is used to analyze the group effect. The p value is less than 2e-16 for the log 2 transformed case comparison, suggesting that the two groups are statistically significantly different. The Asian mask-wearing group clearly has lower growth rates of COVID-19 cases compared to the non-mask-wearing group. Thailand has the highest growth rate among the mask-wearing groups. However, the differences in the growth rate of confirmed cases between these two groups cannot be fully attributed to mask-wearing, but arise from many factors, such as clinical tests performed, complicated social, economic, and cultural differences, and varied public health polices enforcement. The preliminary comparison only provides the rationale to further evaluate if wearing masks is effective for controlling the infectious disease outbreak. Our study has six major assumptions with preliminary evidence. First, the SARS-CoV-2 transmission pathway includes airborne [1, 8, 22–24] with an R0 value exceeding that of influenza and SARS [16, 32, 33]. Second, a proportion of infected cases could be asymptomatic [36, 38, 46, 47]. Third, asymptomatic individuals could transfer the virus in the community [48, 49, 82]. Fourth, the public awareness of mask usage may increase as the pandemic spreads [64]. Fifth, the market could respond to consumer demand with a production increase and without supply chain problems [67]. Sixth, homemade cloth masks are not as effective as commercial medical masks [57, 60]. Thus, we project the best scenario as the pandemic spreads and by the end of the outbreak, the general population will be willing to wear a mask. Although wearing a mask is a low-cost and non-disruptive measure, wearing a mask has not been culturally widespread in many parts of the world [83]. Furthermore, for non-certified medical masks, individual errors could lead to ineffective mask fitting, which could reduce the benefit of wearing a mask [84]. \\nThere are limitations to those six assumptions. First, a recent study suggested that the virus was detected on the outer layer of COVID-19 patients' masks [85], which could invalidate the utility of a patient wearing a mask. However, although the virus was detected, the mask could still provide prevention by reducing the virus load to an adjacent healthy individual. Further studies on asymptomatic individuals wearing masks could be more convincing to validate the effectiveness of wearing a mask to prevent pre-symptomatic transmission. Second, we assume random mixing and model the general population, but have not taken account children's role. Children are less likely to wear masks consistently to realize mask effectiveness. At the same time, the role of children in COVID-19 transmission is unclear [86]. Third, we assume the willing individual who has a mask can use the mask in the right manner and follow social distancing and other personal hygiene practices. There are discrepancies between willingness, perceived compliance, and real compliance [87]. Fourth, research shows that masks can be a source of contamination if not disposed of or replaced in timely manner The COVID-19 pandemic has created a global crisis. Prevention such as vaccines is one of the most effective measures to mitigate such a catastrophic public health crisis. Prior to an available vaccine, NPIs such as wearing a mask can potentially reduce the virus transmission rate. Recent modeling studies suggest that timely and comprehensive NPIs are needed to prevent a secondary wave of COVID-19 [89]. However, timely implementations of NPI such as wearing a mask call for public awareness, a readily available market stockpile, and government advocacy and policies. For respiratory diseases caused by a rival agent through aerosol and droplet transmission routes, wearing masks could be a reasonable NPI to reduce the virus transmission efficiency and secondary transmission [5, 89]. \\nHowever, masks do not replace social distancing and other personal hygiene practices, such as hand washing. The effectiveness of any NPIs depends on compliance rates, contact rate reduction, the role of children, and asymptomatic cases in transmission. Our model analyzes the impact of wearing a mask that can efficiently filter viral aerosols during the COVID-19 pandemic in the general population. Our study suggests that wearing a quality mask in combination with other NPIs can support hospital resource management during a pandemic. In a free market, the risks of not having enough masks for the general population may negatively impact timely responses to the outbreak. Appropriate public health policies and government subsidies could be necessary to manage similar crises in the future. Future studies on how to improve adherence and compliance rates will better position society for potential future respiratory disease outbreaks when the viral agent has a similar clinical attack rate. - 1.

Furthermore, the widespread use of disposable masks has led to shortage of filter materials and problems with their haphazard disposal. In this study, a testing system that is based on standardized methods has been established and enhanced to reliably measure the particle filtration efficiency (PFE) of masks. Quality control experiments that examine the filtration efficiency of polystyrene latex (PSL) particles that are 0.1 µm in size and sodium chloride (NaCl) particles that range from 0.01–1.0 µm are conducted to determine the reliability of the testing system. Moreover, various textile materials are tested to fabricate 3-layer face masks, and the PFE of these masks is tested by using the proposed testing system to find the most suitable materials and the likelihood of their reusability. Among the tested materials, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) used as the membrane in the filter layer has the highest PFE of 88.33% ± 1.80%, which is mainly due to its dense and multilayer structure. The air permeability of the self-developed masks ranges from 1.41 ± 0.04 to 1.93 ± 0.08, less breathable than the commercial masks. The reusability of a mask that uses PTFE as the membrane in the filter layer is tested by gently washing the mask 30 times and then drying the mask in air before the PFE is measured. The PFE is only reduced by 10–20% after 30 washes, thus indicating the potential reusability of the mask. The findings in this study will contribute to reducing the pressure of mask shortages and are an environmentally friendly solution to the massive use of disposable masks. Keywords: COVID-19; Mask testing system; Reusable mask; Particle filtration efficiency. The new coronavirus (COVID-19) has become a global public health concern because it is highly contagious with severe or even fatal health consequences. With the rapid spread of COVID-19, self-protection has become crucial to avoid contracting this disease. \\nAs a highly infectious disease, the two main routes of transmission include direct transmission (e.g., spraying droplets emitted from aerosolized particles through sneezing, coughing or talking), and indirect transmission (contact with surfaces that contain the virus or objects that have been in contact with an infected individual) (Liu, 2020; Ningthoujam, 2020; Tomar and Gupta, 2020). However, the former has been documented to be a more prevalent form of transmission, so an effective mask must be worn to obstruct the transmission of the virus and block its spread when conducting daily life activities (Bałazy et al., 2006; MacIntyre and Chughtai, 2020). This has led to the unprecedented demand and shortage of masks, along with the problem of ineffective masks. On the one hand, there are a variety of different masks on the market. Although most commercially available masks claim effectiveness against contact with airborne particles, their actual performance has not been tested adequately. For example, Cheng (2020) reported that there was no quality control in face mask production in Pakistan. In Italy, in order to meet the huge demand of face masks, some industries have reset the production chain, shifting from the usual target products to the production of masks. However, the quality of the masks is questionable and needs to be tested (Amendola et al., 2020). In addition, Lam et al. (2020) examined 160 mask brands on the market and found that 48.8% of them were substandard and/or invalid. With COVID-19 as an urgent public health issue now, it has become imperative to test and validate the performance of these masks with reliable testing equipment. On the other hand, COVID-19 has led to the unprecedented demand for masks, which has resulted in a shortage of materials to fabricate them. Moreover, most of the masks currently found on the market are disposable (i.e., surgical, N95 and KF94 masks). \\nThe widespread use of such disposable masks is having a detrimental effect on the environment, as additional resources and human resources are needed to properly dispose of used masks which might otherwise end up in the oceans or landfills. As such, it is timely to develop effective yet reusable masks, not only to address the needs of the current epidemic but also to conserve resources. One of the key parameters of masks is their particle filtration efficiency (PFE) which reflects the ability of masks and/or filters to block the inhalation of different types of particles. Basically, PFE testing follows the methods stipulated in various standards, which include ASTM F2299 (the United States) and YY 0469-2011/GB19083-2010 (Chinese), and the standard provided by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). In ASTM F2299, polystyrene latex (PSL) particles of a specific size are used to evaluate the PFE of a material. Although the applicable particle size range is from 0.1 µm to 5.0 µm, PSL particles of 0.1 µm are generally used for testing as it is the most penetrating particle size. In YY 0469-2011, sodium chloride (NaCl) particles that range from 0.01 µm to 1.0 µm are used as the index in PFE testing of masks, while the NIOSH standard is used to test masks to filter NaCl particles that are 0.3 µm in size. Although these standard methods provide basic instructions and parameters for PFE testing, they do not offer specific settings for testing systems and details of the equipment involved. Moreover, some of the standard methods have limitations. For instance, a device that is recommended for measuring particle concentration (an optical particle counter (OPC)) is low in accuracy and size-resolution (Rengasamy et al., 2011). Moreover, the standards do not strictly stipulate the size of the particles to be tested, thus resulting in differences and uncertainties in the results with the different testing agents and systems.

       "   'scraped_text': '\\nAt long last, we have made a truly game-changing scientific breakthrough in preventing the spread of COVID-19. The impact of this breakthrough seems almost too good to be true. We have found a disease control tool that, when used properly, can dramatically reduce the person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Studies have shown that this tool could reduce transmission by somewhere between 50% and 85%. The tool is cheap and remarkably low-tech. You can even make one at home. It has no significant side effects. And with each passing day, the scientific research showing the tool’s effectiveness gets stronger and stronger. If this tool were a vaccine or medicine, we’d be high-fiving each other and popping the champagne, knowing we’d discovered a crucial means to help prevent the spread of the pandemic. I’m talking, of course, about face masks—cloth, surgical, or even a bandanna. Face masks block the spread of respiratory droplets that can carry the novel coronavirus. But just as with so many other aspects of the response to COVID-19—including mass testing, contact tracing, and the early use of stay-at-home orders—the U.S. is once again squandering this opportunity. In many countries that have so far successfully controlled their COVID-19 epidemics, public health leaders, politicians, and the public have fully embraced the use of face masks with no hint of controversy. A recent study found that countries where masks were widely used soon after their COVID-19 outbreak began were more likely to keep their death rates low and to have a shorter outbreak. Countries like Hong Kong, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam that quickly adopted masking, along with other control measures such as social distancing and track and trace, have reported fewer than 6 deaths per million residents as a result of COVID-19. Yet in the U.S., where the death rate from COVID-19 is now 379 per million people, face masks have been weaponized for partisan purposes. \\nTaking their cues from President Trump, who has refused to appear on camera wearing a face mask and has said that Americans who wear masks are doing so to show their disapproval of him, many of his supporters now see wearing a face mask as an affront to personal liberty. According to the Washington Post, Republican leaders “are less likely to mandate them, and Republican voters are more likely to forgo, and even scorn, them.” Health officials who have promoted mask mandates have quit their jobs after receiving death threats. As a result of this alarming polarization, only 18 states and the District of Columbia are mandating face masks in public across the whole state. Only two—Massachusetts and Maryland—have Republican governors. Meanwhile, many Republican-led states are actively trying to subvert local measures. Nebraska Governor Pete Ricketts has gone so far as to say he will withhold federal coronavirus relief funds from local governments if they try and mandate mask use in their places of work. Rejecting face masks inevitably means embracing more COVID-19 cases and deaths. One U.S. study found that states with a mandate had a more rapid decline in daily growth rates of COVID-19 and estimated that mask use prevented up to 450,000 cases of COVID-19 by May 22, 2020. And while researchers at the University of Washington now predict that the U.S. could reach 180,000 COVID-19 deaths by October, they say we could prevent 33,000 of these deaths—more than half of the new deaths the model projects—if at least 95% of people wear a mask. That’s right. We can avert the deaths of 33,000 of our parents, grandparents, siblings, co-workers, teachers, bus drivers, mail carriers, nurses and store and factory workers by just sticking a one-dollar piece of cloth over our noses and mouths. So what’s stopping us? One problem is the “me first” culture in the U.S., in which anti-maskers claim that their right to go around unmasked in public matters more than saving lives. '},\n",

Despite the current limited scientific data detailing their effectiveness, we support the wearing of face coverings by the public when mandated and when in close contact with people whose infection  status they don't know. However, we also encourage everyone to continue to limit their time spent  indoors near potentially infectious people and to not count on or expect a cloth mask or face  covering to protect them or the people around them. The pandemic is not over and will not likely be  over for some time. As states and local jurisdictions reopen, we encourage people to continue to  assess and limit their risks. Cloth masks and face coverings likely do not offer the same degree of  protection as physical distancing, isolation, or limiting personal contact time.  Will face coverings 'flatten the curve' and stop the pandemic?  We have reviewed the many modeling studies that purport to demonstrate that cloth masks or face  coverings have the potential for flattening the curve or significantly decrease the number of cases. These studies fail to recognize several important facts:  • The filter performance of a cloth material does not directly translate or represent its performance on an individual, because it neglects the understanding of fit.  • Cloth masks or coverings come in a variety of shapes, sizes, and materials and are not made  • Transmission is not simply a function of short random interactions between individuals, but  rather a function of particle concentration in the air and the time exposed to that concentration.  • A cloth mask or face covering does very little to prevent the emission or inhalation of small  particles.

COMMENTARY: Masks-for-all for COVID-19 not based on sound data I CIDRAP  small infectious particles is not only biologically plausible, but the epidemiology supports it as an important mode of transmission for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.  In summary, though we support mask wearing by the general public, we continue to conclude that  cloth masks and face coverings are likely to have limited impact on lowering COVID-19  transmission, because they have minimal ability to prevent the emission of small particles, offer  limited personal protection with respect to small particle inhalation, and should not be  recommended as a replacement for physical distancing or reducing time in enclosed spaces with  many potentially infectious people. We are very concerned about messaging that suggests cloth  masks or face coverings can replace physical distancing. We also worry that the public doesn't  understand the limitations of cloth masks and face coverings when we observe how many people  wear their mask under their nose or even under their mouth, remove their masks when talking to  someone nearby, or fail to practice physical distancing when wearing a mask.

       "   'scraped_text': \"This feels like a lopsided fight. In one corner, we have scientists, epidemiologists, infectious-disease physicians, clinicians, engineers—many different experts in the medical community, that is—arguing that the spread of COVID-19 by aerosols (that is, tiny droplets that can remain airborne long enough to travel significantly farther than the six-foot separation we’ve been told to observe) is both real and dangerous. In the other, it’s the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO), which until veryrecently have allowed only that aerosol spread is possible, not necessarily likely. And while watching experts going against governmental agencies isn’t always riveting stuff, this particular battle is terribly important. It has significant implications for how we as a country handle this epidemic, and what decisions we make going forward—and those decisions need to be made sooner, not later. On some level, this is a discussion of droplets versus aerosols. You’ve probably heard plenty this year about droplets: they’re larger in size and may be exhaled by someone talking, shouting, singing, coughing or sneezing. These droplets don’t travel far and fall quickly to the ground, one reason why a “social distance” of roughly six feet is seen as a safe one. If you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today. Aerosols, on the other hand, are tiny by comparison, nearly 10,000 times smaller than a human hair. They’re spread at far greater distances—20 to 30 feet—and can linger in the air for minutes to hours, infecting others. What constitutes a safe distance from aerosols is much harder to define, especially in crowded indoor spaces with poor ventilation. \\nChoosing a safe mask becomes difficult as well: an N95 respirator, for example, would be preferable to an ill-fitting cloth mask when it comes to filtering out these minuscule viral aerosols. For these and other reasons, some in the medical community suspect, our health agencies have been reluctant to accept the data on the airborne transmission of COVID-19—because if they do, they’re acknowledging a problem far more challenging even than what we’ve been dealt with so far. This reluctance has prompted an epic response. In a nearly unprecedented move, 239 scientists from 32 countries wrote an open letter to the WHO in July, urging the agency to recognize that airborne transmission of coronavirus by smaller aerosol particles is possible. The organization’s response was to subsequently update its position, stating that aerosol transmission “cannot be ruled out.” A glowing endorsement this was not—although, points out a spokesperson for the organization, “We have substantial guidance on the topic and speak repeatedly in press conferences and other venues about the importance of keeping indoor spaces well ventilated, precisely because of the potential of aerosol transmission in these settings. WHO has advice in the form of Q&As for the general public, and for people who manage public spaces and buildings and health facilities.” The CDC, meanwhile, posted on its Web site over the weekend that aerosolization may be “the main way the virus spreads,” then backtracked and removed the content from its site, claiming the language had been a draft of some proposed changes which were “posted in error.” This is a major point, not a minor one. Aerosol carry of the virus means that any indoor area where people gather in numbers—think restaurants, bars, churches, schools, rallies—is potentially a spreader of the disease, and depending upon the numbers, a superspreader. These are likely places with poor ventilation, where people not only are close together but may be speaking loudly, shouting, singing, cheering or booing, etc. \\nThe idea of aerosol spread is neither new nor controversial. Several diseases, including measles, chickenpox and tuberculosis, have been shown to be transmitted by aerosols. Patients sick with the flu have the virus in their exhaled breath, and that virus has been shown to be present in the air. This is true for some other viruses, including those found in infants. Scientists in Wuhan, China, have identified coronavirus RNA particles in the air in hospital areas, although they haven’t yet proven that the particles are infectious. Lab workers at the University of Nebraska have published their finding that they, too, have identified coronavirus RNA in the air. “We have pretty strong circumstantial evidence, in a number of these superspreading indoor incidents, that there must have been a significant component of aerosol or airborne transmission,” says William Bahnfleth, chair of the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) Epidemic Task Force. Bahnfleth noted several examples, including a restaurant in Guangzhou, China, where multiple people without direct contact with one another became infected from a single individual, and a choir practice in Washington state where presumed droplet and aerosol spread from singingsickened 53 people, two of whom died. In an e-mail interview, researcher Bjorn Birnir shared his work, published in a preprint (a non–peer reviewed paper), that demonstrated how an infected person continues to exhale a cloud of droplets and aerosols. These “build up over time to dangerous concentrations for everyone in the room,” Birnir says. While we don’t know exactly how much virus is needed to infect people or at what concentrations, these examples show that at some point the threshold is met and inhaled aerosols are the likely culprits. “Aerosol transmission plays a significant role in indoor environments and cannot be neglected,” says environmental science expert Maosheng Yao, a professor of engineering at Peking University. \"},\n",

The reusability of a mask that uses PTFE as the membrane in the filter layer is tested by gently washing the mask 30 times and then drying the mask in air before the PFE is measured. The PFE is only reduced by 10–20% after 30 washes, thus indicating the potential reusability of the mask. The findings in this study will contribute to reducing the pressure of mask shortages and are an environmentally friendly solution to the massive use of disposable masks. Keywords: COVID-19; Mask testing system; Reusable mask; Particle filtration efficiency. The new coronavirus (COVID-19) has become a global public health concern because it is highly contagious with severe or even fatal health consequences. With the rapid spread of COVID-19, self-protection has become crucial to avoid contracting this disease. \\nAs a highly infectious disease, the two main routes of transmission include direct transmission (e.g., spraying droplets emitted from aerosolized particles through sneezing, coughing or talking), and indirect transmission (contact with surfaces that contain the virus or objects that have been in contact with an infected individual) (Liu, 2020; Ningthoujam, 2020; Tomar and Gupta, 2020). However, the former has been documented to be a more prevalent form of transmission, so an effective mask must be worn to obstruct the transmission of the virus and block its spread when conducting daily life activities (Bałazy et al., 2006; MacIntyre and Chughtai, 2020). This has led to the unprecedented demand and shortage of masks, along with the problem of ineffective masks. On the one hand, there are a variety of different masks on the market. Although most commercially available masks claim effectiveness against contact with airborne particles, their actual performance has not been tested adequately. For example, Cheng (2020) reported that there was no quality control in face mask production in Pakistan. In Italy, in order to meet the huge demand of face masks, some industries have reset the production chain, shifting from the usual target products to the production of masks. However, the quality of the masks is questionable and needs to be tested (Amendola et al., 2020). In addition, Lam et al. (2020) examined 160 mask brands on the market and found that 48.8% of them were substandard and/or invalid. With COVID-19 as an urgent public health issue now, it has become imperative to test and validate the performance of these masks with reliable testing equipment. On the other hand, COVID-19 has led to the unprecedented demand for masks, which has resulted in a shortage of materials to fabricate them. Moreover, most of the masks currently found on the market are disposable (i.e., surgical, N95 and KF94 masks). \\nThe widespread use of such disposable masks is having a detrimental effect on the environment, as additional resources and human resources are needed to properly dispose of used masks which might otherwise end up in the oceans or landfills. As such, it is timely to develop effective yet reusable masks, not only to address the needs of the current epidemic but also to conserve resources. One of the key parameters of masks is their particle filtration efficiency (PFE) which reflects the ability of masks and/or filters to block the inhalation of different types of particles. Basically, PFE testing follows the methods stipulated in various standards, which include ASTM F2299 (the United States) and YY 0469-2011/GB19083-2010 (Chinese), and the standard provided by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). In ASTM F2299, polystyrene latex (PSL) particles of a specific size are used to evaluate the PFE of a material. Although the applicable particle size range is from 0.1 µm to 5.0 µm, PSL particles of 0.1 µm are generally used for testing as it is the most penetrating particle size. In YY 0469-2011, sodium chloride (NaCl) particles that range from 0.01 µm to 1.0 µm are used as the index in PFE testing of masks, while the NIOSH standard is used to test masks to filter NaCl particles that are 0.3 µm in size. Although these standard methods provide basic instructions and parameters for PFE testing, they do not offer specific settings for testing systems and details of the equipment involved. Moreover, some of the standard methods have limitations. For instance, a device that is recommended for measuring particle concentration (an optical particle counter (OPC)) is low in accuracy and size-resolution (Rengasamy et al., 2011). Moreover, the standards do not strictly stipulate the size of the particles to be tested, thus resulting in differences and uncertainties in the results with the different testing agents and systems.

       "   'scraped_text': \"A log transformed analysis is conducted to evaluate the growth rate of COVID-19 infections. ANOVA analysis is used to analyze the group effect. The p value is less than 2e-16 for the log 2 transformed case comparison, suggesting that the two groups are statistically significantly different. The Asian mask-wearing group clearly has lower growth rates of COVID-19 cases compared to the non-mask-wearing group. Thailand has the highest growth rate among the mask-wearing groups. However, the differences in the growth rate of confirmed cases between these two groups cannot be fully attributed to mask-wearing, but arise from many factors, such as clinical tests performed, complicated social, economic, and cultural differences, and varied public health polices enforcement. The preliminary comparison only provides the rationale to further evaluate if wearing masks is effective for controlling the infectious disease outbreak. Our study has six major assumptions with preliminary evidence. First, the SARS-CoV-2 transmission pathway includes airborne [1, 8, 22–24] with an R0 value exceeding that of influenza and SARS [16, 32, 33]. Second, a proportion of infected cases could be asymptomatic [36, 38, 46, 47]. Third, asymptomatic individuals could transfer the virus in the community [48, 49, 82]. Fourth, the public awareness of mask usage may increase as the pandemic spreads [64]. Fifth, the market could respond to consumer demand with a production increase and without supply chain problems [67]. Sixth, homemade cloth masks are not as effective as commercial medical masks [57, 60]. Thus, we project the best scenario as the pandemic spreads and by the end of the outbreak, the general population will be willing to wear a mask. Although wearing a mask is a low-cost and non-disruptive measure, wearing a mask has not been culturally widespread in many parts of the world [83]. Furthermore, for non-certified medical masks, individual errors could lead to ineffective mask fitting, which could reduce the benefit of wearing a mask [84]. \\nThere are limitations to those six assumptions. First, a recent study suggested that the virus was detected on the outer layer of COVID-19 patients' masks [85], which could invalidate the utility of a patient wearing a mask. However, although the virus was detected, the mask could still provide prevention by reducing the virus load to an adjacent healthy individual. Further studies on asymptomatic individuals wearing masks could be more convincing to validate the effectiveness of wearing a mask to prevent pre-symptomatic transmission. Second, we assume random mixing and model the general population, but have not taken account children's role. Children are less likely to wear masks consistently to realize mask effectiveness. At the same time, the role of children in COVID-19 transmission is unclear [86]. Third, we assume the willing individual who has a mask can use the mask in the right manner and follow social distancing and other personal hygiene practices. There are discrepancies between willingness, perceived compliance, and real compliance [87]. Fourth, research shows that masks can be a source of contamination if not disposed of or replaced in timely manner The COVID-19 pandemic has created a global crisis. Prevention such as vaccines is one of the most effective measures to mitigate such a catastrophic public health crisis. Prior to an available vaccine, NPIs such as wearing a mask can potentially reduce the virus transmission rate. Recent modeling studies suggest that timely and comprehensive NPIs are needed to prevent a secondary wave of COVID-19 [89]. However, timely implementations of NPI such as wearing a mask call for public awareness, a readily available market stockpile, and government advocacy and policies. For respiratory diseases caused by a rival agent through aerosol and droplet transmission routes, wearing masks could be a reasonable NPI to reduce the virus transmission efficiency and secondary transmission [5, 89]. \\nHowever, masks do not replace social distancing and other personal hygiene practices, such as hand washing. The effectiveness of any NPIs depends on compliance rates, contact rate reduction, the role of children, and asymptomatic cases in transmission. Our model analyzes the impact of wearing a mask that can efficiently filter viral aerosols during the COVID-19 pandemic in the general population. Our study suggests that wearing a quality mask in combination with other NPIs can support hospital resource management during a pandemic. In a free market, the risks of not having enough masks for the general population may negatively impact timely responses to the outbreak. Appropriate public health policies and government subsidies could be necessary to manage similar crises in the future. Future studies on how to improve adherence and compliance rates will better position society for potential future respiratory disease outbreaks when the viral agent has a similar clinical attack rate. - 1.

In this study, a testing system that is based on standardized methods has been established and enhanced to reliably measure the particle filtration efficiency (PFE) of masks. Quality control experiments that examine the filtration efficiency of polystyrene latex (PSL) particles that are 0.1 µm in size and sodium chloride (NaCl) particles that range from 0.01–1.0 µm are conducted to determine the reliability of the testing system. Moreover, various textile materials are tested to fabricate 3-layer face masks, and the PFE of these masks is tested by using the proposed testing system to find the most suitable materials and the likelihood of their reusability.

Despite the current limited scientific data detailing their effectiveness, we support the wearing of face coverings by the public when mandated and when in close contact with people whose infection  status they don't know. However, we also encourage everyone to continue to limit their time spent  indoors near potentially infectious people and to not count on or expect a cloth mask or face  covering to protect them or the people around them. The pandemic is not over and will not likely be  over for some time. As states and local jurisdictions reopen, we encourage people to continue to  assess and limit their risks. Cloth masks and face coverings likely do not offer the same degree of  protection as physical distancing, isolation, or limiting personal contact time.  Will face coverings 'flatten the curve' and stop the pandemic?  We have reviewed the many modeling studies that purport to demonstrate that cloth masks or face  coverings have the potential for flattening the curve or significantly decrease the number of cases. These studies fail to recognize several important facts:  • The filter performance of a cloth material does not directly translate or represent its performance on an individual, because it neglects the understanding of fit.  • Cloth masks or coverings come in a variety of shapes, sizes, and materials and are not made  • Transmission is not simply a function of short random interactions between individuals, but  rather a function of particle concentration in the air and the time exposed to that concentration.  • A cloth mask or face covering does very little to prevent the emission or inhalation of small  particles.

In summary, though we support mask wearing by the general public, we continue to conclude that  cloth masks and face coverings are likely to have limited impact on lowering COVID-19  transmission, because they have minimal ability to prevent the emission of small particles, offer  limited personal protection with respect to small particle inhalation, and should not be  recommended as a replacement for physical distancing or reducing time in enclosed spaces with  many potentially infectious people. We are very concerned about messaging that suggests cloth  masks or face coverings can replace physical distancing. We also worry that the public doesn't  understand the limitations of cloth masks and face coverings when we observe how many people  wear their mask under their nose or even under their mouth, remove their masks when talking to  someone nearby, or fail to practice physical distancing when wearing a mask.

       "   'scraped_text': \"This feels like a lopsided fight. In one corner, we have scientists, epidemiologists, infectious-disease physicians, clinicians, engineers—many different experts in the medical community, that is—arguing that the spread of COVID-19 by aerosols (that is, tiny droplets that can remain airborne long enough to travel significantly farther than the six-foot separation we’ve been told to observe) is both real and dangerous. In the other, it’s the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO), which until veryrecently have allowed only that aerosol spread is possible, not necessarily likely. And while watching experts going against governmental agencies isn’t always riveting stuff, this particular battle is terribly important. It has significant implications for how we as a country handle this epidemic, and what decisions we make going forward—and those decisions need to be made sooner, not later. On some level, this is a discussion of droplets versus aerosols. You’ve probably heard plenty this year about droplets: they’re larger in size and may be exhaled by someone talking, shouting, singing, coughing or sneezing. These droplets don’t travel far and fall quickly to the ground, one reason why a “social distance” of roughly six feet is seen as a safe one. If you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today. Aerosols, on the other hand, are tiny by comparison, nearly 10,000 times smaller than a human hair. They’re spread at far greater distances—20 to 30 feet—and can linger in the air for minutes to hours, infecting others. What constitutes a safe distance from aerosols is much harder to define, especially in crowded indoor spaces with poor ventilation. \\nChoosing a safe mask becomes difficult as well: an N95 respirator, for example, would be preferable to an ill-fitting cloth mask when it comes to filtering out these minuscule viral aerosols. For these and other reasons, some in the medical community suspect, our health agencies have been reluctant to accept the data on the airborne transmission of COVID-19—because if they do, they’re acknowledging a problem far more challenging even than what we’ve been dealt with so far. This reluctance has prompted an epic response. In a nearly unprecedented move, 239 scientists from 32 countries wrote an open letter to the WHO in July, urging the agency to recognize that airborne transmission of coronavirus by smaller aerosol particles is possible. The organization’s response was to subsequently update its position, stating that aerosol transmission “cannot be ruled out.” A glowing endorsement this was not—although, points out a spokesperson for the organization, “We have substantial guidance on the topic and speak repeatedly in press conferences and other venues about the importance of keeping indoor spaces well ventilated, precisely because of the potential of aerosol transmission in these settings. WHO has advice in the form of Q&As for the general public, and for people who manage public spaces and buildings and health facilities.” The CDC, meanwhile, posted on its Web site over the weekend that aerosolization may be “the main way the virus spreads,” then backtracked and removed the content from its site, claiming the language had been a draft of some proposed changes which were “posted in error.” This is a major point, not a minor one. Aerosol carry of the virus means that any indoor area where people gather in numbers—think restaurants, bars, churches, schools, rallies—is potentially a spreader of the disease, and depending upon the numbers, a superspreader. These are likely places with poor ventilation, where people not only are close together but may be speaking loudly, shouting, singing, cheering or booing, etc. \\nThe idea of aerosol spread is neither new nor controversial. Several diseases, including measles, chickenpox and tuberculosis, have been shown to be transmitted by aerosols. Patients sick with the flu have the virus in their exhaled breath, and that virus has been shown to be present in the air. This is true for some other viruses, including those found in infants. Scientists in Wuhan, China, have identified coronavirus RNA particles in the air in hospital areas, although they haven’t yet proven that the particles are infectious. Lab workers at the University of Nebraska have published their finding that they, too, have identified coronavirus RNA in the air. “We have pretty strong circumstantial evidence, in a number of these superspreading indoor incidents, that there must have been a significant component of aerosol or airborne transmission,” says William Bahnfleth, chair of the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) Epidemic Task Force. Bahnfleth noted several examples, including a restaurant in Guangzhou, China, where multiple people without direct contact with one another became infected from a single individual, and a choir practice in Washington state where presumed droplet and aerosol spread from singingsickened 53 people, two of whom died. In an e-mail interview, researcher Bjorn Birnir shared his work, published in a preprint (a non–peer reviewed paper), that demonstrated how an infected person continues to exhale a cloud of droplets and aerosols. These “build up over time to dangerous concentrations for everyone in the room,” Birnir says. While we don’t know exactly how much virus is needed to infect people or at what concentrations, these examples show that at some point the threshold is met and inhaled aerosols are the likely culprits. “Aerosol transmission plays a significant role in indoor environments and cannot be neglected,” says environmental science expert Maosheng Yao, a professor of engineering at Peking University. \"}],\n",

Some of the ads have used familiar, and misleading, talking points. On health care: An ad from the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee claims that Republican Rep. Martha McSally “voted to essentially end Medicare,” a reference to a GOP budget resolution calling for significant changes — not an end — to Medicare. On taxes: Several ads in House races claim the Republican tax law, passed in late 2017, gives 83 percent of the benefits to the top 1 percent. That’s only the case for 2027, because most of the individual income tax changes in the law expire by then. Republicans say a future Congress will extend the tax cuts. In 2025, a quarter of the tax cuts go to the top 1 percent. This ad from the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee dredges up an old claim we haven’t heard much in recent years — saying Republican Rep. Martha McSally of Arizona “voted to essentially end Medicare.” That’s a reference to a budget plan, first proposed by Rep. Paul Ryan, that calls for changing Medicare — not ending it — to a system in which seniors would use premium-support payments to select their own plan from a Medicare exchange. Longtime readers of FactCheck.org surely remember this claim from 2011, 2012, the 2014 midterms and more. Democratic Rep. Kyrsten Sinema also tweeted the claim in mid-October. Both the tweet and the ad include the words “essentially end Medicare” in quotes and refer to a Wall Street Journal article. But that’s a truncated quote from the 2011 Journal article, which said Ryan’s plan “would essentially end Medicare, which now pays most of the health-care bills for 48 million elderly and disabled Americans, as a program that directly pays those bills.” So it wouldn’t terminate the Medicare program, as the ad says. Instead, it would change how the program operates. \\nRyan’s plan got the most attention in 2011, when he first introduced it, and in 2012, when Ryan was Mitt Romney’s presidential running mate. It has continued to be a part of GOP budget proposals, even though it has not moved forward in legislation to actually implement it. McSally voted for the GOP House budget resolution in 2017, which again included Ryan’s premium-support proposal. (The vote got the most attention for being the first step toward Republicans passing a tax cut plan.) The DSCC also points to a 2012 interview with McSally, when she was running in a special election for the House, in which she said she would have voted for the Ryan budget. She added that there were things she disagreed with in the bill “as far as Medicare” — without elaborating on that point — “but of the options, I think that one was the best one put forward.” A budget resolution doesn’t actually implement policy — it’s not binding law, but rather a blueprint of the budget and priorities. The Ryan plan, as we’ve written before, would be a fundamental change for Medicare. It would affect those under age 55, who, once eligible for Medicare, would be given a choice of private plans or traditional Medicare and federal subsidies to help pay for them. It would be similar to Medicare Advantage meets the Affordable Care Act’s insurance exchanges. There are both critics and supporters of this type of plan, and whether it would be beneficial or more/less expensive for seniors is a matter of debate. The DSCC emphasizes that it’s a “voucher” program, while Ryan prefers “premium-support” plan. But whatever you call it, it wouldn’t “end” the federal health care program for seniors. Many Democrats have assailed their opponents’ positions on preexisting conditions, pointing to votes to repeal the Affordable Care Act, votes for Republican health care plans and support for a lawsuit in Texas seeking to invalidate the Affordable Care Act. \\nThe DSCC ad, too, adds that McSally voted to “gut protections for preexisting conditions,” citing her votes for the House-passed American Health Care Act and a 2015 vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act. The ACA instituted broad protections for those with preexisting conditions — prohibiting insurers from denying policies, excluding coverage or pricing plans based on health status. That primarily affected the individual market, where such practices were common, and where people without employer-sponsored plans or public coverage, such as Medicare and Medicaid, buy their own coverage. It’s true that repealing the ACA would repeal those protections, and the GOP repeal-and-replace plans considered by Congress in 2017 would have weakened those protections. The House’s American Health Care Act would allow insurers to price plans based on health status in some cases where there was a gap in coverage, and allow states to change or eliminate ACA requirements for insurers to cover certain benefits (see “The Preexisting Conditions Debate” for the details on the bill). Other Democratic ads – such as this one from Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill – have referred to the Texas lawsuit, brought by Republican officials in 20 states and supported by the Trump administration. The Department of Justice said if the lawsuit were successful, the entire ACA wouldn’t need to be scrapped; however, it said the provisions prohibiting insurance companies from denying coverage or charging more based on health status would have to be eliminated. If the ACA’s protections were to be eliminated or repealed, there would still be some previously existing protections for those with employer plans, who couldn’t be denied coverage or charged more based on health status under the 1996 Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. Before the ACA, those with employer plans could face coverage exclusions, however, if they had a gap in insurance coverage.

The DSCC emphasizes that it’s a “voucher” program, while Ryan prefers “premium-support” plan. But whatever you call it, it wouldn’t “end” the federal health care program for seniors. Many Democrats have assailed their opponents’ positions on preexisting conditions, pointing to votes to repeal the Affordable Care Act, votes for Republican health care plans and support for a lawsuit in Texas seeking to invalidate the Affordable Care Act. \\nThe DSCC ad, too, adds that McSally voted to “gut protections for preexisting conditions,” citing her votes for the House-passed American Health Care Act and a 2015 vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act. The ACA instituted broad protections for those with preexisting conditions — prohibiting insurers from denying policies, excluding coverage or pricing plans based on health status. That primarily affected the individual market, where such practices were common, and where people without employer-sponsored plans or public coverage, such as Medicare and Medicaid, buy their own coverage. It’s true that repealing the ACA would repeal those protections, and the GOP repeal-and-replace plans considered by Congress in 2017 would have weakened those protections. The House’s American Health Care Act would allow insurers to price plans based on health status in some cases where there was a gap in coverage, and allow states to change or eliminate ACA requirements for insurers to cover certain benefits (see “The Preexisting Conditions Debate” for the details on the bill). Other Democratic ads – such as this one from Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill – have referred to the Texas lawsuit, brought by Republican officials in 20 states and supported by the Trump administration. The Department of Justice said if the lawsuit were successful, the entire ACA wouldn’t need to be scrapped; however, it said the provisions prohibiting insurance companies from denying coverage or charging more based on health status would have to be eliminated. If the ACA’s protections were to be eliminated or repealed, there would still be some previously existing protections for those with employer plans, who couldn’t be denied coverage or charged more based on health status under the 1996 Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. Before the ACA, those with employer plans could face coverage exclusions, however, if they had a gap in insurance coverage.

Making improvements to Medicare is a laudable goal, but doing it in a way that will cost the average senior thousands of dollars at a time in their life when they can least afford it is not. Neither is shortchanging the hardworking Americans who have paid into the system throughout their working lives. Perhaps the most visible plan to cut Medicare is the one endorsed by House Speaker Paul Ryan, which would eliminate the guaranteed level of coverage that Medicare currently provides — e.g., covering hospital care and 80 percent of the total cost of doctor visits — and replace it with “vouchers” with which seniors would be directed to buy their own health insurance from the private sector. Other plans being circulated in Congress contemplate similar approaches, the end result of which can best be described as shifting more risk to seniors – a risk that means either paying more for their healthcare or getting less of it. Under these congressional plans, what happens to seniors if, for example, the values of the vouchers they receive fail to provide them with enough to buy what Medicare now covers? And what happens if the ongoing costs of their coverage exceed the amount of the vouchers they will now receive? The two choices appear to be a) either pay more out of their own pocket for the same coverage, or b) skip the medical care in question. While Speaker Ryan has dubbed his voucher-based approach “premium support,” no one should be misled by the benign-sounding term. This is a clear downgrade of the Medicare benefits people have earned throughout their working lives, and the use of buzzwords like “modernization” and “choice” cannot hide the fact that seniors will be asked to bear more risk at greater personal cost. \\nTo justify what they position as the “we-have-no-choice” necessity of their plans, congressional leaders have characterized Medicare, in operation for more than 50 years, as “going broke.” That’s simply not true. In fact, both the Medicare Trustees Report and The Congressional Budget Office report that Medicare’s fiscal strength has improved — not declined — in recent years and that the Medicare trust fund is fully funded through 2029 and 79-percent funded through 2040, a highly manageable shortfall that can be closed in coming years without experimenting with, or reducing, seniors’ healthcare coverage. In an effort to make their plans to diminish Medicare seem more palatable, and be able to say that “no current Medicare beneficiaries will be affected,” the timeline for the proposed cuts is said to be pushed out a few years. But that fails to explain that when these new changes do kick in, current beneficiaries will be affected. By moving younger, healthier seniors into private plans via the use of vouchers, those now in the traditional Medicare program will see their own premiums rise dramatically. As a result, the Medicare benefits they have earned throughout their working lives and count upon may soon become unaffordable. Fortunately for seniors and their families, those same congressional plans to alter Medicare’s fundamental promises will likely bump up against President Donald Trump, who campaigned on promises not to “touch” the benefits seniors have earned. The new President first expressed his views on the subject and distinguished himself from other Republican primary contenders and went on to make his commitment not to cut Medicare an ongoing element of his general-election campaign: “I am going to protect and save your Social Security and your Medicare. Not only do seniors nationwide strongly oppose such changes, but Medicare cuts and congressional plans to reduce Medicare’s long-standing promise to people run afoul of the new President’s often-stated views on the subject.

For instance, Sinema’s team pointed to a January 2017 concurrent resolution setting a budget blueprint for fiscal year 2017; Sinema voted against it, McSally for it. Its main purpose was to facilitate repeal of the Affordable Care Act. But the resolution did create the possibility of making changes to Medicare that could be interpreted as cuts, said Paul N. Van de Water, a senior fellow at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, where he specializes in Medicare, Social Security, and health coverage issues. Still, budget resolutions even if they pass do not become law; they lay out a plan. Budget resolutions also don’t affect Social Security — at least not directly — because there are rules against it, Van de Water said. Sinema’s team pointed to McSally and Sinema’s stance on transitioning Medicare to the Republican-favored \"premium support\" program, or \"vouchers\" as Democrats critically call it. Under the premium support/voucher system, beneficiaries would receive a payment to buy private insurance, or a traditional fee-for-service Medicare plan. A goal of switching over to the premium support/voucher approach is to reduce the growth in Medicare spending. Arguments against the switch include concerns that it would shift more costs to beneficiaries over time. Van de Water told PolitiFact that a premium support/voucher system would in most cases make traditional Medicare more expensive relative to the Medicare Advantage Plans (Medicare plans offered by a private company that contracts with Medicare). It’s fair to say that voting for a premium support/voucher system would be, at least in principle, a vote for cuts in Medicare, Van de Water said.

In fact, both the Medicare Trustees Report and The Congressional Budget Office report that Medicare’s fiscal strength has improved — not declined — in recent years and that the Medicare trust fund is fully funded through 2029 and 79-percent funded through 2040, a highly manageable shortfall that can be closed in coming years without experimenting with, or reducing, seniors’ healthcare coverage. In an effort to make their plans to diminish Medicare seem more palatable, and be able to say that “no current Medicare beneficiaries will be affected,” the timeline for the proposed cuts is said to be pushed out a few years. But that fails to explain that when these new changes do kick in, current beneficiaries will be affected. By moving younger, healthier seniors into private plans via the use of vouchers, those now in the traditional Medicare program will see their own premiums rise dramatically. As a result, the Medicare benefits they have earned throughout their working lives and count upon may soon become unaffordable. Fortunately for seniors and their families, those same congressional plans to alter Medicare’s fundamental promises will likely bump up against President Donald Trump, who campaigned on promises not to “touch” the benefits seniors have earned. The new President first expressed his views on the subject and distinguished himself from other Republican primary contenders and went on to make his commitment not to cut Medicare an ongoing element of his general-election campaign: “I am going to protect and save your Social Security and your Medicare. Not only do seniors nationwide strongly oppose such changes, but Medicare cuts and congressional plans to reduce Medicare’s long-standing promise to people run afoul of the new President’s often-stated views on the subject. '}, page_content='Medicare is being targeted by key congressional leaders for a sweeping set of changes that would dramatically increase healthcare costs for seniors and ultimately leave them paying more for their healthcare while getting less. Making improvements to Medicare is a laudable goal, but doing it in a way that will cost the average senior thousands of dollars at a time in their life when they can least afford it is not. Neither is shortchanging the hardworking Americans who have paid into the system throughout their working lives. Perhaps the most visible plan to cut Medicare is the one endorsed by House Speaker Paul Ryan, which would eliminate the guaranteed level of coverage that Medicare currently provides — e.g., covering hospital care and 80 percent of the total cost of doctor visits — and replace it with “vouchers” with which seniors would be directed to buy their own health insurance from the private sector. Other plans being circulated in Congress contemplate similar approaches, the end result of which can best be described as shifting more risk to seniors – a risk that means either paying more for their healthcare or getting less of it. Under these congressional plans, what happens to seniors if, for example, the values of the vouchers they receive fail to provide them with enough to buy what Medicare now covers? And what happens if the ongoing costs of their coverage exceed the amount of the vouchers they will now receive? The two choices appear to be a) either pay more out of their own pocket for the same coverage, or b) skip the medical care in question. While Speaker Ryan has dubbed his voucher-based approach “premium support,” no one should be misled by the benign-sounding term. This is a clear downgrade of the Medicare benefits people have earned throughout their working lives, and the use of buzzwords like “modernization” and “choice” cannot hide the fact that seniors will be asked to bear more risk at greater personal cost.

Some of the ads have used familiar, and misleading, talking points. On health care: An ad from the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee claims that Republican Rep. Martha McSally “voted to essentially end Medicare,” a reference to a GOP budget resolution calling for significant changes — not an end — to Medicare. On taxes: Several ads in House races claim the Republican tax law, passed in late 2017, gives 83 percent of the benefits to the top 1 percent. That’s only the case for 2027, because most of the individual income tax changes in the law expire by then. Republicans say a future Congress will extend the tax cuts. In 2025, a quarter of the tax cuts go to the top 1 percent. This ad from the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee dredges up an old claim we haven’t heard much in recent years — saying Republican Rep. Martha McSally of Arizona “voted to essentially end Medicare.” That’s a reference to a budget plan, first proposed by Rep. Paul Ryan, that calls for changing Medicare — not ending it — to a system in which seniors would use premium-support payments to select their own plan from a Medicare exchange. Longtime readers of FactCheck.org surely remember this claim from 2011, 2012, the 2014 midterms and more. Democratic Rep. Kyrsten Sinema also tweeted the claim in mid-October. Both the tweet and the ad include the words “essentially end Medicare” in quotes and refer to a Wall Street Journal article. But that’s a truncated quote from the 2011 Journal article, which said Ryan’s plan “would essentially end Medicare, which now pays most of the health-care bills for 48 million elderly and disabled Americans, as a program that directly pays those bills.” So it wouldn’t terminate the Medicare program, as the ad says. Instead, it would change how the program operates. ', 'context_after': 'The DSCC ad, too, adds that McSally voted to “gut protections for preexisting conditions,” citing her votes for the House-passed American Health Care Act and a 2015 vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act. The ACA instituted broad protections for those with preexisting conditions — prohibiting insurers from denying policies, excluding coverage or pricing plans based on health status. That primarily affected the individual market, where such practices were common, and where people without employer-sponsored plans or public coverage, such as Medicare and Medicaid, buy their own coverage. It’s true that repealing the ACA would repeal those protections, and the GOP repeal-and-replace plans considered by Congress in 2017 would have weakened those protections. The House’s American Health Care Act would allow insurers to price plans based on health status in some cases where there was a gap in coverage, and allow states to change or eliminate ACA requirements for insurers to cover certain benefits (see “The Preexisting Conditions Debate” for the details on the bill). Other Democratic ads – such as this one from Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill – have referred to the Texas lawsuit, brought by Republican officials in 20 states and supported by the Trump administration. The Department of Justice said if the lawsuit were successful, the entire ACA wouldn’t need to be scrapped; however, it said the provisions prohibiting insurance companies from denying coverage or charging more based on health status would have to be eliminated. If the ACA’s protections were to be eliminated or repealed, there would still be some previously existing protections for those with employer plans, who couldn’t be denied coverage or charged more based on health status under the 1996 Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. Before the ACA, those with employer plans could face coverage exclusions, however, if they had a gap in insurance coverage. For more on those details, see our story “Kavanaugh and the Preexisting Conditions Debate.” '}, page_content='Ryan’s plan got the most attention in 2011, when he first introduced it, and in 2012, when Ryan was Mitt Romney’s presidential running mate. It has continued to be a part of GOP budget proposals, even though it has not moved forward in legislation to actually implement it. McSally voted for the GOP House budget resolution in 2017, which again included Ryan’s premium-support proposal. (The vote got the most attention for being the first step toward Republicans passing a tax cut plan.) The DSCC also points to a 2012 interview with McSally, when she was running in a special election for the House, in which she said she would have voted for the Ryan budget. She added that there were things she disagreed with in the bill “as far as Medicare” — without elaborating on that point — “but of the options, I think that one was the best one put forward.” A budget resolution doesn’t actually implement policy — it’s not binding law, but rather a blueprint of the budget and priorities. The Ryan plan, as we’ve written before, would be a fundamental change for Medicare. It would affect those under age 55, who, once eligible for Medicare, would be given a choice of private plans or traditional Medicare and federal subsidies to help pay for them. It would be similar to Medicare Advantage meets the Affordable Care Act’s insurance exchanges. There are both critics and supporters of this type of plan, and whether it would be beneficial or more/less expensive for seniors is a matter of debate. The DSCC emphasizes that it’s a “voucher” program, while Ryan prefers “premium-support” plan. But whatever you call it, it wouldn’t “end” the federal health care program for seniors. Many Democrats have assailed their opponents’ positions on preexisting conditions, pointing to votes to repeal the Affordable Care Act, votes for Republican health care plans and support for a lawsuit in Texas seeking to invalidate the Affordable Care Act.

Although Trump told Republican senators that lowering prescription prices is “something you have to do,” many remain reluctant to use federal authority to force drugmakers to charge less. Meanwhile, congressional Democrats calculate that the election will strengthen their hand, and they’ll finally be able to enact a law that authorizes Medicare to negotiate prices directly. Neither side in Congress has had an incentive to deal, and the White House has been unable to work Trump’s will. Last year the House did pass Pelosi’s Medicare negotiations bill, which would have capped out-of-pocket drug costs for older people and expanded program benefits as well. It had no path forward in the Republican Senate, and the White House calls it unworkable. But there was an alternative. A bipartisan Senate bill backed by Trump stopped short of giving Medicare bargaining power, but would have limited annual price increases and capped costs for older people. The bill passed out of a Senate committee but was never brought to the full body. “It’s not clear why the administration hasn’t made a bigger push to line up votes to get a bill through the Senate and a deal with Congress, given strong public support to lower drug costs,” said Tricia Neuman, a Medicare expert with the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation. Americans remain worried about drug costs, with nearly 9 in 10 saying in a recent Gallup-West Health poll that they’re concerned the pharmaceutical industry will take advantage of the coronavirus pandemic to raise prices. Another Gallup-West Health survey found 65% saying the Trump administration had made little or no progress limiting increases in prescription drug costs.

It’s a particularly important issue for older people, who rely on medications to manage the medical problems associated with advancing age. '}, page_content='WASHINGTON (AP) — Unable to land the big deal with Congress to curb drug costs, President Donald Trump on Friday moved on his own to allow imports of cheaper medicines, along with other limited steps that could have some election-year appeal. At a White House ceremony, Trump signed four executive orders. One was about importation. The others would direct drugmaker rebates straight to patients, provide insulin and EpiPens at steep discounts to low-income people, and use lower international prices to pay for some Medicare drugs. Trump cast his directives as far-reaching, but they mostly update earlier administration ideas that have not yet gone into effect. “I’m unrigging the system that is many decades old,” he declared, promising “massive” savings. Consumers may not notice immediate changes, since the orders must be carried out by the federal bureaucracy and could face court challenges. WATCH: Trump announces $5 billion more for nursing homes Democrats, meanwhile, are eager to draw a contrast between Trump and their own sweeping plans to authorize Medicare to negotiate lower prices with pharmaceutical companies, an idea the president had backed as a candidate. A bill by Speaker Nancy Pelosi already passed the House and aligns with presidential candidate Joe Biden’s approach. Friday’s event was definitely not the bill-signing the White House had once hoped for. Trump came into office complaining that pharmaceutical companies were “getting away with murder” and promising to bring them under control. Nearly four years later, things are much the same despite some recent moderation in price increases. Trump pulled his punches, Pelosi said in a statement. “After promising that he would ‘negotiate like crazy’ for lower prescription drug prices, it is clear that President Trump meant not negotiate at all,” she said, adding that if Trump is serious about lowering prices he should tell Senate Republicans to pass her bill.

The news broke just before 10 p.m. on the West Coast, when most prominent cable TV anchors, Beltway reporters and in-house doctors are usually fast asleep or just ending their day. Whether jostled out of bed like NBC’s Andrea Mitchell or powering straight through like CNN’s Don Lemon, each had to walk a fine line while reporting on the grim irony of Trump testing positive for a deadly virus that he’s repeatedly sought to downplay. Human compassion faced off with politics, well-wishing with hard, cold facts as TV news came to grips with what veteran NBC journalist Brian Williams described as a “colossal story.” Dr. Sanjay Gupta, whose profession demands he respond quickly to medical emergencies, was on CNN within minutes of the news breaking, replete with sopping wet hair. (Heck, it’s possible he was wearing only a towel from the waist down.) He said the odds were good for Trump and that he should recover but that the news should not be “entirely unexpected” given the president’s lax use of masks. To that point, the network produced the viral clip of Trump making fun of challenger Joe Biden during Tuesday’s presidential debate for wearing protective face coverings in public. “He could be speaking 200 feet away from you, and he shows up with the biggest mask I’ve ever seen!” Bedheaded Washington Post newsman Carl Bernstein was all too happy to light into the president for knowingly putting the lives of Americans in danger when he failed to take decisive measures to curb the pandemic despite understanding its severity earlier this year. \\nAnd why had the president attended a rally Wednesday after learning that Hope Hicks — his closest nonfamilial advisor — had tested positive, asked Anderson Cooper, who joined the CNN crew around midnight. MSNBC’s go-to COVID-19 expert, Dr. Vin Gupta (no relation to Sanjay), was also on the air within minutes of the story breaking. He clarified, as he has for months, the seriousness of the disease, then tried, delicately, to explain why the president is among the population at higher risk for severe illness. . Trump will probably be just fine, he said, but he’s a senior so there’s a higher likelihood of him becoming very sick or dying of COVID — and then “there’s the question of his BMI” body mass index. The subject of Trump’s weight was clearly uncomfortable. He’s “obese,” Gupta said carefully, and that puts him in more danger. The Fox News team looked shellshocked as they broke the news, repeating that the president and his staff get tested daily — which they supplemented, as Friday wore on, with a somewhat new-for-the-network emphasis on the important of mask-wearing and hand-washing. (“Apparently that wasn’t enough,” one guest said of the testing regime.) The news outlet has been widely criticized for amplifying the White House’s dismissal of, and misinformation about, COVID-19 — almost right up to the moment the president tweeted that he and the first lady had tested positive. In a live interview with Trump earlier Thursday evening, Fox personality Sean Hannity waited a full 10 minutes before broaching the biggest story of the day as if it were a mere sidebar: “By the way, some news broke earlier this evening,” Hannity said, referring to Hicks’ positive test.

The social media site pointed to a policy in place since April when commenting to Vice’s Motherboard on its ability to suspend people for their comments about Trump. Twitter’s policies allow for users engaging in “abusive behavior” to be suspended, including when posting “content that wishes, hopes or expresses a desire for death, serious bodily harm or fatal disease against an individual.” “Hoping that someone dies as a result of a serious disease” is listed as a specific example within the guidelines’ section outlining explanations of abusive behavior. Negative content recently flooded social media following Trump’s announcement early on Oct. 2 that he would be quarantining and seeking treatment after testing positive for the coronavirus. Recent hashtags that trended in the U.S. include “#TrumpHasCovid” and the more recent “#CovidCaughtTrump.” Many users tweeted out “thoughts and prayers” for the President or celebrated “karma” — a term which also trended, given the recent comments Trump made mocking former Vice President Biden for always wearing a mask. But others also used Twitter to express hope that the pandemic would result in the President’s death.

Statistically speaking, the president is most likely to make a full recovery—but his age (74), his gender and the fact that he is obese work against him. According to CDC data, about 8% of COVID-19 patients aged 65-74 die from the disease, and 18% of those aged 75-84 (https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#demographics). Males have a worse outcome than females with COVID-19, both in terms of the seriousness of the illness and in the risk of death (https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)31748-7/fulltext). The president, with a body mass index of 30.5 according to his June 2020 health survey, also qualifies as obese. Obese patients with COVID-19 are 74% more likely to be admitted to an ICU and 48% more likely to die (https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/09/why-covid-19-more-deadly-people-obesity-even-if-theyre-young). However, the President does have the advantage of access to the very best health care in the world, as evidenced by his early treatment with an experimental antibody cocktail made by the biotech company Regeneron (https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/02/health/trump-antibody-treatment.html?referringSource=articleShare) and subsequent infusions of the antiviral drug Remdesivir. According to his personal physician, Naval Commander Sean P. Conley, the president is also being given zinc, Vitamin D, melatonin, aspirin and famotidine as adjunctive therapies. '}, page_content='The shocking announcement, as has often been the case during the Trump presidency, came in form of a tweet the middle of the night. The president’s message was simple and straightforward: “Tonight, @FLOTUS and I tested positive for COVID-19. We will begin our quarantine and recovery process immediately. We will get through this TOGETHER!” (https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1311892190680014849?s=11) The realization that Donald Trump, who has been described during the COVID-19 pandemic as “the world’s most tested man,” had contracted the disease himself only reinforced what has become increasingly evident in the past few months: Over the 24 hour period after the presidential announcement, numerous members of the White House inner circle and a large number of other presidential contacts were found to have tested positive: Trump advisors Hope Hicks and Kellyanne Conway, campaign manager Bill Stepien, Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel, former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, Republican Senators Mike Lee and Thom Tillis, and even Notre Dame President John Jenkins, all of whom attended federal judge Amy Coney Barrett’s Rose Garden nomination ceremony last Saturday. Health care professionals watching both that ceremony and the first presidential debate proceedings in Cleveland were mortified to see many participants not wearing masks—including all of the Trump family members in attendance at the debate. The President even ridiculed Vice President Biden about his mask-wearing during the debate, saying, “You could be speaking 200 feet away from him and he shows up with the biggest mask I’ve ever seen.” But it was an over-reliance on an inherently fallible SARS CoV-2 antigen test, and disdain for social distancing and mask-wearing, that likely allowed COVID-19 to breach the White House bubble.

For others working in the White House and the administration, however, there are lines not to be crossed, according to the Hatch Act, a 1939 federal law that prohibits most government officials from engaging in political activities while on the job. Trump administration officials have been cited for breaking the Hatch Act 13 times by federal investigators at the Office of Special Counsel, an independent federal investigative and prosecutorial agency. At least a dozen more investigations are apparently under way, according to executive branch sources and legal watchdog groups. “White House counsel has been very, very strict with us. They’ve sent out many, many one-pagers and emails explaining what can and can’t be done,” Stephanie Grisham, the first lady’s chief of staff, replied to a question Tuesday from VOA. “Everybody needs to do things on their own time. You cannot use government equipment — all of those things. The first lady used the newly renovated Rose Garden as the site for her live address Tuesday night to the Republican Party’s convention, which formally renominated her husband Monday. A few meters away, lights, speakers and a stage, with ample space for an invited audience, have been erected on the White House South Lawn for Thursday night’s nomination acceptance speech by the president. Trump’s address is to be followed by fireworks launched from the National Mall. “The president and vice president are not covered by any of the provisions of the Hatch Act. Accordingly, the Hatch Act does not prohibit President Trump from delivering his RNC acceptance speech on White House grounds,” Erica Hamrick, deputy chief of the Hatch Act Unit at the Office of Special Counsel, wrote this month in a written response to the House Oversight Committee. \\nThat has not quelled criticism about the use of the White House for an explicitly political event. For much of his presidency, Trump has used official events, including news conferences and speeches inside and out of the White House, to repeatedly attack his political foes. Due to the coronavirus pandemic, Republicans and Democrats significantly scaled back their political conventions. Former Vice President Joe Biden and his running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris, made their acceptance speeches in Biden’s hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, with only a few dozen journalists and campaign staff in the room. Trump traveled Monday to Charlotte, North Carolina, the first day of his party’s event, to speak to several hundred delegates. In the evening, the convention’s program contained two events with the president and guests in the White House specifically taped for the telecast. Vice President Mike Pence is scheduled to deliver his nomination acceptance speech Wednesday evening at Fort McHenry in Maryland, the site of a battle in the War of 1812 that inspired The Star-Spangled Banner, the U.S. national anthem. Expenses, including travel, that are deemed political are supposed to be paid by the president’s reelection campaign, not the U.S. government. If Trump delivers his acceptance speech on White House grounds, this decision will violate ethics norms established by former presidents, said Georgia Lyon, a communications fellow at the nonpartisan Campaign Legal Center. “There have been a variety of ways the White House has been used in the past for influencing elections that may have run afoul of the law,” Scott Bloch, head of the Office of Special Counsel from 2003 to 2008, told the Government Executive newsletter. He cited the Bill Clinton administration renting out areas of the White House for fundraisers and the administration of George H.W. Bush using federal funds and resources to help Republican candidates. \\nHowever, former Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama tried to ensure the line was not crossed between their duties as public servants and political candidates. They were observed keeping political activities at the White House limited to the residence area or those that are not regularly used solely in the discharge of official duties, in accordance with the Hatch Act. There is one other current significant departure from precedent – Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s address to the Republican convention Tuesday night will be from Israel during a diplomatic trip. “It’s a break in tradition – one of many breaks in tradition that we can associate with the Trump presidency,” Matthew Continetti, resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, told VOA. Pompeo, a former congressman, is doing it, not only to maintain his presence in Republican politics – looking beyond the Trump administration – but “also to remind the viewers that the Trump administration is not without accomplishments in the foreign policy arena,” Continetti said. It is rare for the nation’s top diplomat to engage is such an explicitly political act. The speech by Pompeo during an overseas mission is a “blatant use of office for overtly political purposes” that undermines the critical work being done by the State Department, Biden’s deputy campaign manager, Kate Bedingfield, said. A State Department official said Pompeo’s address was being done in his personal capacity. Even if any activities by Trump administration officials result in findings that they violated the Hatch Act, punishment is left to their bosses. Trump has not acted against those working for him already deemed violators.

Normally, an official from the Bureau of the Fiscal Service signs the checks to protect against the perception of political patronage. IRS staff had to reprogram the agency’s computers to add the president’s name to the template for millions of paper stimulus checks, which threatened delays in disbursement. At a coronavirus press briefing, the president noted, “I’m sure people will be very happy to get a big, fat, beautiful check, and my name is on it.” The president’s request to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to sign the checks may have been a violation of the Hatch Act, which prohibits the president from commanding federal officials to engage in certain political activities. Favoring Political Allies with National Guard Funding Although most states are facing severe budget crunches as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Trump administration announced that they would have to begin covering 25 percent of the cost of deploying National Guard troops to fight the coronavirus — with the exception of two states governed by the president’s allies, Texas and Florida. States like Arizona and California, whose outbreaks were no less severe, were not exempted. The administration did not provide an explanation for this decision beyond that the Texas and Florida governors had made “special, direct cases to the President.” Following criticism, the administration announced that Arizona, California, and Connecticut would also see their National Guard deployments completely funded by the federal government. However, unlike Texas and Florida, whose costs are covered through the end of 2020, Arizona, California, and Connecticut will have to begin paying a share of their costs in October. Blurring Lines Between Political Speeches and Government Business During Virtual Convention \\nAfter the Covid-19 pandemic interfered with plans to hold the Republican National Convention (RNC) in North Carolina or Florida, President Trump and several members of his administration delivered their convention speeches from government-related locations, blurring the lines between their official and personal roles and raising significant ethical and legal concerns. During the virtual RNC, President Trump delivered a speech accepting his party’s nomination for president from the South Lawn of the White House. He also appeared to use the office of the presidency as a political prop by issuing a formal pardon and speaking at a naturalization ceremony in video segments that aired as part of the event (in the latter case, without informing the immigrants that they were participating in the RNC). In addition, First Lady Melania Trump gave her RNC address from the White House Rose Garden, Vice President Mike Pence spoke from Fort McHenry (which is located on federal property), and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appeared as an RNC speaker while in Jerusalem on a diplomatic visit (a notable location given the administration’s controversial decision to move the U.S. embassy there from Tel Aviv in 2018). Convention speeches from the White House and other government locations violate a longstanding norm of presidential administrations maintaining clear boundaries between official government business and partisan campaign activities. Ethics experts have noted that the Hatch Act, a civil service law, bars federal employees from participating in certain political activities while acting in their official capacities. In response to concerns from members of Congress, the Office of the Special Counsel (OSC) issued an opinion stating that because the president and the vice president are not bound by the Hatch Act, their RNC speech locations would not constitute violations (The letter made no mention of the First Lady.). \\nBut as the OSC letter noted, White House employees are covered by the Hatch Act, meaning the event venue could pose legal issues for staff depending on their level of participation. OSC also explained that White House employees are prohibited from using their official authority to influence election outcomes; thus, Hatch Act issues could emerge if White House staff worked on convention-related tasks. (Notably, career civil servants across the federal government have faced significant consequences for Hatch Act violations, while President Trump’s political appointees and close advisers have not.) Furthermore, holding RNC events on federal property could violate a separate law against coercion of political activity if government employees were pressured to participate. Secretary Pompeo’s RNC speech was also controversial, violating a longstanding norm when he became the first sitting secretary of state in modern history to speak at a party convention. Reflecting a principle articulated shortly after World War II that U.S. foreign policy should represent all Americans and remain isolated from domestic politics, Pompeo’s predecessors have occasionally attended their party’s conventions, but none have spoken at them. For instance, in 2004, then Secretary of State Colin Powell explained that he would not attend the RNC because, “As secretary of state, I am obliged not to participate in any way, shape, fashion or form in parochial, political debates. I have to take no sides in the matter.” In fact, Pompeo’s speech appears to violate a State Department policy meant to strengthen the division between diplomacy and politics that Pompeo himself recently approved, which warns politically appointed officials that they are barred from “engaging in partisan political activities while on duty, and, in many circumstances, even when you are off duty.” RNC leadership has defended these controversial aspects of the convention on the grounds that the Covid-19 pandemic upended a traditional political convention.

Then you\\'ve already seen quite a bit of the White House, and there\\'s more on the way. President Donald Trump will formally accept the Republican nomination Thursday from the South Lawn, where a stage was being constructed over the weekend. The first lady is set to deliver her remarks Tuesday night from the newly renovated Rose Garden. And Trump is making \"surprise\" appearances, with guests, from inside the White House during the convention. The use of the White House as a convention backdrop is unconventional and comes as Trump and the RNC scrambled to finalize details amid cancellations and COVID-19. Previous presidents have avoided blurring the line between campaign-style events, such as party conventions, with the official business of governing from the White House. Now, questions are bubbling about the propriety of the arrangement. RNC night one: Democrat Vernon Jones says Biden is \\'all talk and no action\\' White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows defended Trump\\'s decision to deliver his convention address from the White House, saying Monday it is necessary during the \"unprecedented time” as the country battles the COVID-19 pandemic. He also stated the venue choice was purposeful, noting Trump is \"willing to travel everywhere\" but that the background of the White House matches the message the president wishes to send to voters. “No, it\\'s not about convenience,\" Meadows said. \"I think it\\'s about for most people wanting to understand and hear from the President of the United States on what he\\'s going to do to make sure the next four years continue to build on the last four years.” Still, government watchdog groups and others worry that even the appearance of a political event at the White House raises concerns about ethical conflicts. Trump giving his acceptance speech at the White House has raised questions about the Hatch Act. \\nThe Hatch Act is a 1939 law that restricts federal employees\\' engagement in specific partisan political activities, with the aim of preventing members of the executive branch from interfering in elections. These prohibited activities include running for office, hosting fundraisers, making campaign speeches or distributing campaign materials. Courting young voters: GOP activist Charlie Kirk calls Trump the \\'bodyguard of western civilization\\' After concerns were raised following the announcement of the speech location, the U.S. Office of Special Counsel said in a letter that Trump could deliver his RNC speech from the White House because \"the President and Vice President are not covered by any of the provisions of the Hatch Act.\" But White House employees technically would not be able to assist in the address, with the letter explaining they \"are covered by the Hatch Act, so there may be Hatch Act implications for those employees, depending on their level of involvement with the event and their position in the White House.\" Judd Deere, a White House spokesman, said the White House would be careful to abide by the Hatch Act, saying “RNC convention events will be planned and executed, at whatever the venue, by the Trump campaign and RNC.” “Any government employees who may participate will do so in compliance with the Hatch Act,” he said. Republicans are arguing that the speech on the South Lawn may avoid the part of the Hatch Act\\'s provision that prohibits partisan activities in federal buildings, as they interpret that location as part of the president\\'s residence. This won\\'t be the first time a sitting president has used the White House to accept a party\\'s nomination. In 1940, President Franklin D. Roosevelt delivered his acceptance speech from the White House via radio to the Democratic convention that nominated him for an unprecedented third term. Trump also used several rooms of the White House as the backdrop for a few round-table segments during the RNC on Monday.

Trump traveled Monday to Charlotte, North Carolina, the first day of his party’s event, to speak to several hundred delegates. In the evening, the convention’s program contained two events with the president and guests in the White House specifically taped for the telecast. Vice President Mike Pence is scheduled to deliver his nomination acceptance speech Wednesday evening at Fort McHenry in Maryland, the site of a battle in the War of 1812 that inspired The Star-Spangled Banner, the U.S. national anthem. Expenses, including travel, that are deemed political are supposed to be paid by the president’s reelection campaign, not the U.S. government. If Trump delivers his acceptance speech on White House grounds, this decision will violate ethics norms established by former presidents, said Georgia Lyon, a communications fellow at the nonpartisan Campaign Legal Center. “There have been a variety of ways the White House has been used in the past for influencing elections that may have run afoul of the law,” Scott Bloch, head of the Office of Special Counsel from 2003 to 2008, told the Government Executive newsletter. He cited the Bill Clinton administration renting out areas of the White House for fundraisers and the administration of George H.W. Bush using federal funds and resources to help Republican candidates. \\nHowever, former Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama tried to ensure the line was not crossed between their duties as public servants and political candidates. They were observed keeping political activities at the White House limited to the residence area or those that are not regularly used solely in the discharge of official duties, in accordance with the Hatch Act. There is one other current significant departure from precedent – Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s address to the Republican convention Tuesday night will be from Israel during a diplomatic trip. “It’s a break in tradition – one of many breaks in tradition that we can associate with the Trump presidency,” Matthew Continetti, resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, told VOA. Pompeo, a former congressman, is doing it, not only to maintain his presence in Republican politics – looking beyond the Trump administration – but “also to remind the viewers that the Trump administration is not without accomplishments in the foreign policy arena,” Continetti said. It is rare for the nation’s top diplomat to engage is such an explicitly political act. The speech by Pompeo during an overseas mission is a “blatant use of office for overtly political purposes” that undermines the critical work being done by the State Department, Biden’s deputy campaign manager, Kate Bedingfield, said. A State Department official said Pompeo’s address was being done in his personal capacity. Even if any activities by Trump administration officials result in findings that they violated the Hatch Act, punishment is left to their bosses. Trump has not acted against those working for him already deemed violators.

Normally, an official from the Bureau of the Fiscal Service signs the checks to protect against the perception of political patronage. IRS staff had to reprogram the agency’s computers to add the president’s name to the template for millions of paper stimulus checks, which threatened delays in disbursement. At a coronavirus press briefing, the president noted, “I’m sure people will be very happy to get a big, fat, beautiful check, and my name is on it.” The president’s request to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to sign the checks may have been a violation of the Hatch Act, which prohibits the president from commanding federal officials to engage in certain political activities. Favoring Political Allies with National Guard Funding Although most states are facing severe budget crunches as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Trump administration announced that they would have to begin covering 25 percent of the cost of deploying National Guard troops to fight the coronavirus — with the exception of two states governed by the president’s allies, Texas and Florida. States like Arizona and California, whose outbreaks were no less severe, were not exempted. The administration did not provide an explanation for this decision beyond that the Texas and Florida governors had made “special, direct cases to the President.” Following criticism, the administration announced that Arizona, California, and Connecticut would also see their National Guard deployments completely funded by the federal government. However, unlike Texas and Florida, whose costs are covered through the end of 2020, Arizona, California, and Connecticut will have to begin paying a share of their costs in October. Blurring Lines Between Political Speeches and Government Business During Virtual Convention \\nAfter the Covid-19 pandemic interfered with plans to hold the Republican National Convention (RNC) in North Carolina or Florida, President Trump and several members of his administration delivered their convention speeches from government-related locations, blurring the lines between their official and personal roles and raising significant ethical and legal concerns. During the virtual RNC, President Trump delivered a speech accepting his party’s nomination for president from the South Lawn of the White House. He also appeared to use the office of the presidency as a political prop by issuing a formal pardon and speaking at a naturalization ceremony in video segments that aired as part of the event (in the latter case, without informing the immigrants that they were participating in the RNC). In addition, First Lady Melania Trump gave her RNC address from the White House Rose Garden, Vice President Mike Pence spoke from Fort McHenry (which is located on federal property), and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appeared as an RNC speaker while in Jerusalem on a diplomatic visit (a notable location given the administration’s controversial decision to move the U.S. embassy there from Tel Aviv in 2018). Convention speeches from the White House and other government locations violate a longstanding norm of presidential administrations maintaining clear boundaries between official government business and partisan campaign activities. Ethics experts have noted that the Hatch Act, a civil service law, bars federal employees from participating in certain political activities while acting in their official capacities. In response to concerns from members of Congress, the Office of the Special Counsel (OSC) issued an opinion stating that because the president and the vice president are not bound by the Hatch Act, their RNC speech locations would not constitute violations (The letter made no mention of the First Lady.). \\nBut as the OSC letter noted, White House employees are covered by the Hatch Act, meaning the event venue could pose legal issues for staff depending on their level of participation. OSC also explained that White House employees are prohibited from using their official authority to influence election outcomes; thus, Hatch Act issues could emerge if White House staff worked on convention-related tasks. (Notably, career civil servants across the federal government have faced significant consequences for Hatch Act violations, while President Trump’s political appointees and close advisers have not.) Furthermore, holding RNC events on federal property could violate a separate law against coercion of political activity if government employees were pressured to participate. Secretary Pompeo’s RNC speech was also controversial, violating a longstanding norm when he became the first sitting secretary of state in modern history to speak at a party convention. Reflecting a principle articulated shortly after World War II that U.S. foreign policy should represent all Americans and remain isolated from domestic politics, Pompeo’s predecessors have occasionally attended their party’s conventions, but none have spoken at them. For instance, in 2004, then Secretary of State Colin Powell explained that he would not attend the RNC because, “As secretary of state, I am obliged not to participate in any way, shape, fashion or form in parochial, political debates. I have to take no sides in the matter.” In fact, Pompeo’s speech appears to violate a State Department policy meant to strengthen the division between diplomacy and politics that Pompeo himself recently approved, which warns politically appointed officials that they are barred from “engaging in partisan political activities while on duty, and, in many circumstances, even when you are off duty.” RNC leadership has defended these controversial aspects of the convention on the grounds that the Covid-19 pandemic upended a traditional political convention.

Trump administration officials have been cited for breaking the Hatch Act 13 times by federal investigators at the Office of Special Counsel, an independent federal investigative and prosecutorial agency. At least a dozen more investigations are apparently under way, according to executive branch sources and legal watchdog groups. “White House counsel has been very, very strict with us.

Then you\\'ve already seen quite a bit of the White House, and there\\'s more on the way. President Donald Trump will formally accept the Republican nomination Thursday from the South Lawn, where a stage was being constructed over the weekend. The first lady is set to deliver her remarks Tuesday night from the newly renovated Rose Garden. And Trump is making \"surprise\" appearances, with guests, from inside the White House during the convention. The use of the White House as a convention backdrop is unconventional and comes as Trump and the RNC scrambled to finalize details amid cancellations and COVID-19. Previous presidents have avoided blurring the line between campaign-style events, such as party conventions, with the official business of governing from the White House. Now, questions are bubbling about the propriety of the arrangement. RNC night one: Democrat Vernon Jones says Biden is \\'all talk and no action\\' White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows defended Trump\\'s decision to deliver his convention address from the White House, saying Monday it is necessary during the \"unprecedented time” as the country battles the COVID-19 pandemic. He also stated the venue choice was purposeful, noting Trump is \"willing to travel everywhere\" but that the background of the White House matches the message the president wishes to send to voters. “No, it\\'s not about convenience,\" Meadows said. \"I think it\\'s about for most people wanting to understand and hear from the President of the United States on what he\\'s going to do to make sure the next four years continue to build on the last four years.” Still, government watchdog groups and others worry that even the appearance of a political event at the White House raises concerns about ethical conflicts. Trump giving his acceptance speech at the White House has raised questions about the Hatch Act. \\nThe Hatch Act is a 1939 law that restricts federal employees\\' engagement in specific partisan political activities, with the aim of preventing members of the executive branch from interfering in elections. These prohibited activities include running for office, hosting fundraisers, making campaign speeches or distributing campaign materials. Courting young voters: GOP activist Charlie Kirk calls Trump the \\'bodyguard of western civilization\\' After concerns were raised following the announcement of the speech location, the U.S. Office of Special Counsel said in a letter that Trump could deliver his RNC speech from the White House because \"the President and Vice President are not covered by any of the provisions of the Hatch Act.\" But White House employees technically would not be able to assist in the address, with the letter explaining they \"are covered by the Hatch Act, so there may be Hatch Act implications for those employees, depending on their level of involvement with the event and their position in the White House.\" Judd Deere, a White House spokesman, said the White House would be careful to abide by the Hatch Act, saying “RNC convention events will be planned and executed, at whatever the venue, by the Trump campaign and RNC.” “Any government employees who may participate will do so in compliance with the Hatch Act,” he said. Republicans are arguing that the speech on the South Lawn may avoid the part of the Hatch Act\\'s provision that prohibits partisan activities in federal buildings, as they interpret that location as part of the president\\'s residence. This won\\'t be the first time a sitting president has used the White House to accept a party\\'s nomination. In 1940, President Franklin D. Roosevelt delivered his acceptance speech from the White House via radio to the Democratic convention that nominated him for an unprecedented third term. Trump also used several rooms of the White House as the backdrop for a few round-table segments during the RNC on Monday.

The windows on a pair of French doors facing the Rose Garden that reporters can typically see through were covered. At one point Friday, the doors were briefly left open, providing a view of construction equipment and workers milling about. Days of construction on the White House grounds even upended the president’s usual routine. Trump was unable to take the Marine One helicopter Thursday to Andrews Air Force base, motorcading instead. The stage setup with overhead lights appeared to be half the height of the White House and resembled that of an outdoor music festival, with large speakers off to the side. Unlike Biden, Trump is expected to have a visible live audience for his remarks that will include members of Congress. At least one other convention speech will be made from the White House grounds with first lady Melania Trump expected to make her speech from the recently renovated Rose Garden. The nearby Trump hotel will serve as a workspace for convention staffers. Trump had pushed to hold an in-person convention, first in North Carolina then in Florida, but abruptly canceled those plans just over 30 days before it was set to begin, sending staffers scrambling to come up with an alternative plan. It was only on Monday that Trump announced he had settled on the White House for his speech. The Trump campaign and Republican National Committee have said they will reimburse the federal government for any taxpayer resources used. White House lawyers have briefed staffers on what they can and cannot do as part of the convention planning and participation, and White House press staffers last week were quick to say they had no involvement in the convention planning outside their office doors, telling reporters to direct any questions to the Trump campaign. '}, page_content=\"WASHINGTON — Several rows of stage lights could be seen peeking above the colonial style windows of the West Wing when the sun rose Friday as the atmosphere of the White House began to transition, for the first time, into a purely political venue. Behind the scenes this past week, campaign and convention staffers began work on the White House South Lawn setting up lights, speakers and a stage that would be used for President Donald Trump to deliver his acceptance speech as the Republican Party’s presidential nominee. Trucks brought in long metal poles and beams, and construction equipment was set up adjacent to the Rose Garden. It is unprecedented in modern politics for the White House to be used as the site of an explicitly political event, with past presidents maintaining some boundaries between the office of the presidency and their re-election bids. Trump has been smashing those norms for months — attacking Democratic rival Joe Biden from the Rose Garden and playing campaign-style videos in the White House briefing room — but his prime-time convention address will represent the most blatant blurring of the lines yet. In suggesting the White House for his acceptance speech after surging coronavirus cases forced him to cancel plans for a large in-person convention, Trump said earlier this month it would be “a very convenient location that would be by far the least expensive location. There would be very little in terms of that tremendous traveling, security with airplanes and everybody flying all over the place. But since the convention speech is a political activity, the expense of traveling to deliver it would have been borne by Trump's campaign, not taxpayers. The potential cost and inconvenience also didn’t stop Trump from making four other campaign stops across the country this week in Pennsylvania, Arizona, Minnesota and Wisconsin. \"), Document(metadata={'url': 'https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-steps-white-house-rnc-backdrop-ethical-legal/story?id=72624917', 'context_before': '', 'context_after': 'House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Wednesday hammered Republicans over their use of the White House during the convention and slammed Pompeo’s decision to speak at it during an official trip abroad, both of which she called “illegal.\" “These people are so unethical,\" Pelosi said on a call with reporters. \"The committees will make their decisions about how they go forward on Pompeo. We also have an issue with Pompeo, for not giving us documents... so they\\'ve been in violation on many scores. Rep. Joaquin Castro of Texas, a senior Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, has already opened an investigation into Pompeo\\'s participation in the RNC from Israel -- and is seeking more information about any internal legal vetting of the move, whether any staff were involved in the setup for his speech, and if his participation had an impact on planning for his trip to the region. \"It\\'s absolutely unacceptable that a sitting U.S. Secretary of State, America\\'s top diplomat, would use official taxpayer-funded business to participate in a political party convention, particularly after the State Department published guidance that explicitly prohibits such activity,\" Castro said in a statement Tuesday. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer added to reporters on the same call with Pelosi Wednesday that Trump will further \"destroy\" American precedents if given a second term in office. “This is what we can expect in a second Trump administration,\" Schumer said. \"All the rules, norms, values that have made this country great, Donald Trump will destroy them. He doesn\\'t care. He only cares about himself. The rules are you shouldn\\'t sit in the White House and give a speech at a convention. Donald Trump says, \\'I want to do it.\\' So they do it.\" Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, is also scheduled to speak Wednesday night and Vice President Mike Pence will address the convention from Fort McHenry, a national monument overseen by the National Park Service. '}, page_content='Trump steps up using White House as RNC backdrop despite ethical, legal concerns \"Nobody outside of the Beltway really cares,\" a top White House official said. Chief of Staff Mark Meadows on Wednesday dismissed growing criticism about President Donald Trump\\'s use of the White House as a political backdrop for the Republican National Convention, calling it \"a lot of hooplah\" being raised \"mainly because the convention has been so unbelievably successful.\" \"Nobody outside of the Beltway really cares,\" Meadows told Politico Wednesday morning. Trump and Republicans have steamrolled norms in RNC programming by using the White House and the powers of the federal government in service to his reelection effort, expanding on that Tuesday when Trump, in a surprise appearance, presided over a presidential pardon and a naturalization ceremony inside White House, later shown as part of the convention program, before first lady Melania Trump delivered remarks in the Rose Garden -- where a renovation was finished just in time for her speech. The first lady\\'s chief of staff denied the timing of the renovation had anything to do with her speech. But Trump administration officials sprinkled into the programming also raised concerns about potential violations of the Hatch Act, which prohibits federal employees from using their official authority to affect an election. In another sign that the line between official government and campaign business has been breached, the Trump campaign confirmed to ABC News that White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany will speak at Wednesday night\\'s program. McEnany, whose salary is paid by taxpayers, is just the latest White House official to be announced as a speaker at this week\\'s convention pushing to re-elect the president. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Director of the Economic Council Larry Kudlow and acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf have already made appearances.

Normally, an official from the Bureau of the Fiscal Service signs the checks to protect against the perception of political patronage. IRS staff had to reprogram the agency’s computers to add the president’s name to the template for millions of paper stimulus checks, which threatened delays in disbursement. At a coronavirus press briefing, the president noted, “I’m sure people will be very happy to get a big, fat, beautiful check, and my name is on it.” The president’s request to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to sign the checks may have been a violation of the Hatch Act, which prohibits the president from commanding federal officials to engage in certain political activities. Favoring Political Allies with National Guard Funding Although most states are facing severe budget crunches as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Trump administration announced that they would have to begin covering 25 percent of the cost of deploying National Guard troops to fight the coronavirus — with the exception of two states governed by the president’s allies, Texas and Florida. States like Arizona and California, whose outbreaks were no less severe, were not exempted. The administration did not provide an explanation for this decision beyond that the Texas and Florida governors had made “special, direct cases to the President.” Following criticism, the administration announced that Arizona, California, and Connecticut would also see their National Guard deployments completely funded by the federal government. However, unlike Texas and Florida, whose costs are covered through the end of 2020, Arizona, California, and Connecticut will have to begin paying a share of their costs in October. Blurring Lines Between Political Speeches and Government Business During Virtual Convention ', 'context_after': 'But as the OSC letter noted, White House employees are covered by the Hatch Act, meaning the event venue could pose legal issues for staff depending on their level of participation. OSC also explained that White House employees are prohibited from using their official authority to influence election outcomes; thus, Hatch Act issues could emerge if White House staff worked on convention-related tasks. (Notably, career civil servants across the federal government have faced significant consequences for Hatch Act violations, while President Trump’s political appointees and close advisers have not.) Furthermore, holding RNC events on federal property could violate a separate law against coercion of political activity if government employees were pressured to participate. Secretary Pompeo’s RNC speech was also controversial, violating a longstanding norm when he became the first sitting secretary of state in modern history to speak at a party convention. Reflecting a principle articulated shortly after World War II that U.S. foreign policy should represent all Americans and remain isolated from domestic politics, Pompeo’s predecessors have occasionally attended their party’s conventions, but none have spoken at them. For instance, in 2004, then Secretary of State Colin Powell explained that he would not attend the RNC because, “As secretary of state, I am obliged not to participate in any way, shape, fashion or form in parochial, political debates. I have to take no sides in the matter.” In fact, Pompeo’s speech appears to violate a State Department policy meant to strengthen the division between diplomacy and politics that Pompeo himself recently approved, which warns politically appointed officials that they are barred from “engaging in partisan political activities while on duty, and, in many circumstances, even when you are off duty.” RNC leadership has defended these controversial aspects of the convention on the grounds that the Covid-19 pandemic upended a traditional political convention. '}, page_content='After the Covid-19 pandemic interfered with plans to hold the Republican National Convention (RNC) in North Carolina or Florida, President Trump and several members of his administration delivered their convention speeches from government-related locations, blurring the lines between their official and personal roles and raising significant ethical and legal concerns. During the virtual RNC, President Trump delivered a speech accepting his party’s nomination for president from the South Lawn of the White House. He also appeared to use the office of the presidency as a political prop by issuing a formal pardon and speaking at a naturalization ceremony in video segments that aired as part of the event (in the latter case, without informing the immigrants that they were participating in the RNC). In addition, First Lady Melania Trump gave her RNC address from the White House Rose Garden, Vice President Mike Pence spoke from Fort McHenry (which is located on federal property), and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appeared as an RNC speaker while in Jerusalem on a diplomatic visit (a notable location given the administration’s controversial decision to move the U.S. embassy there from Tel Aviv in 2018). Convention speeches from the White House and other government locations violate a longstanding norm of presidential administrations maintaining clear boundaries between official government business and partisan campaign activities. Ethics experts have noted that the Hatch Act, a civil service law, bars federal employees from participating in certain political activities while acting in their official capacities. In response to concerns from members of Congress, the Office of the Special Counsel (OSC) issued an opinion stating that because the president and the vice president are not bound by the Hatch Act, their RNC speech locations would not constitute violations (The letter made no mention of the First Lady.).

Some of the candidates on stage that night support Medicare for All. Sanders’ version of it is a single, national health insurance program that would cover everyone who lives in the United States. There would be no out-of-pocket costs to individuals — no deductibles, no copays or coinsurance — but anyone with a job or self-employed would pay into the system through taxes. In that sense, coverage would not be free for anyone who works. (Some immigrants in the country illegally pay income taxes.) Candidates in favor of Medicare for All share the goal of universal coverage but some are wary of a full replacement of the current mix of private and public insurance. Some candidates favor a plan that allows people to keep their private insurance and buy into a \"public option.\" Also, Sanders’ 2017 Medicare for All bill said that the Secretary of Health and Human Services would be the one to set residency requirements for coverage eligibility. At this point, there isn’t a rule for purposes of health care coverage that outlines the U.S. residency criteria. Health care was a key topic of the June 27 debate in Miami and at some point, Guthrie turned the conversation to coverage for people here illegally. Guthrie: \"A lot of you have been talking tonight about these government health care plans that you proposed in one form or another. This is a show of hands question. And hold them up for a moment so people can see. Raise your hand if — if your government plan would provide coverage for undocumented immigrants.\" Guthrie then asked Buttigieg to support his affirmative answer. Buttigieg: \"Our country is healthier when everybody is healthier. And remember, we’re talking about something people are getting a — given a chance to buy into. \\nIn the same way that there are undocumented immigrants in my community who pay, they pay sales taxes, they pay property taxes directly or indirectly. This is not about a handout. This is an insurance program. And we do ourselves no favor by having 11 million undocumented people in our country be unable to access health care.\" Biden: \"You cannot let — as the mayor said, you cannot let people who are sick, no matter where they come from, no matter what their status, go uncovered. You can’t do that. It’s just going to be taken care of, period. You have to. It’s the humane thing to do. \"But here’s the deal. The deal is that he’s right about three things. Number one, they in fact contribute to the well-being of the country, but they also — for example, they’ve increased the lifespan of Social Security because they’re — they have a job. They’re paying the Social Security tax. That’s what they’re doing. It’s increased the lifespan. They would do the same thing in terms of reducing the overall cost of health care by them being able to be treated and not wait until they’re in extremis.\" So all candidates raised their hands affirming they’d have a plan that would offer coverage for immigrants in the country illegally. But the question did not directly ask if coverage would be free. Buttigieg specifically said people would buy the coverage, and that it was \"not about a handout.\" Biden in his answer spoke about the contributions of immigrants in the country illegally — and said that if they had health care coverage, they’d be reducing the cost of the overall health care system.

Meanwhile, fact checkers call the candidates out on their rhetoric about babies being kept in cages. Video: Democratic Hopefuls Say Undocumented Should Have Health-Care Access In Thursday night’s presidential debate on NBC, all 10 Democratic hopefuls showed support for access to health care for everyone — regardless of immigration status. Pete Buttigieg expressed the sentiments of his fellow debaters when he said: “This is not about a handout. This is an insurance program. We do ourselves no favors by having 11 million undocumented people in our country be unable to access health care.” And then he added: “The real problem is we shouldn't have 11 million undocumented people with no pathway to citizenship. It makes no sense. The American people agree on what to do. This is a crazy thing. If leadership consists of forming a consensus around a divisive issue, this White House divided us around a consensus issue.

Some of the candidates on stage that night support Medicare for All. Sanders’ version of it is a single, national health insurance program that would cover everyone who lives in the United States. There would be no out-of-pocket costs to individuals — no deductibles, no copays or coinsurance — but anyone with a job or self-employed would pay into the system through taxes. In that sense, coverage would not be free for anyone who works. (Some immigrants in the country illegally pay income taxes.) Candidates in favor of Medicare for All share the goal of universal coverage but some are wary of a full replacement of the current mix of private and public insurance. Some candidates favor a plan that allows people to keep their private insurance and buy into a \"public option.\" Also, Sanders’ 2017 Medicare for All bill said that the Secretary of Health and Human Services would be the one to set residency requirements for coverage eligibility. At this point, there isn’t a rule for purposes of health care coverage that outlines the U.S. residency criteria. Health care was a key topic of the June 27 debate in Miami and at some point, Guthrie turned the conversation to coverage for people here illegally. Guthrie: \"A lot of you have been talking tonight about these government health care plans that you proposed in one form or another. This is a show of hands question. And hold them up for a moment so people can see. Raise your hand if — if your government plan would provide coverage for undocumented immigrants.\" Guthrie then asked Buttigieg to support his affirmative answer. Buttigieg: \"Our country is healthier when everybody is healthier. And remember, we’re talking about something people are getting a — given a chance to buy into. ', 'context_after': \"All candidates raised their hand. But the question did not ask if the coverage would be for free. Two of the candidates who were able to provide context — Buttigieg and Biden — did not say it would be for free. Some candidates on stage that night support universal health care coverage, through Medicare for All. But there isn’t agreement among all candidates on the provisions of that type of coverage. A version of Medicare for All would offer coverage to all individuals by replacing premiums, co-pays and deductibles. One way the government would pay for Medicare for All would be through payroll taxes; so immigrants in the country illegally who do pay income taxes would contribute that way.

This is not about a handout. This is an insurance program. And we do ourselves no favor by having 11 million undocumented people in our country be unable to access health care.\" Biden: \"You cannot let — as the mayor said, you cannot let people who are sick, no matter where they come from, no matter what their status, go uncovered. You can’t do that. It’s just going to be taken care of, period. You have to. It’s the humane thing to do. \"But here’s the deal. The deal is that he’s right about three things. Number one, they in fact contribute to the well-being of the country, but they also — for example, they’ve increased the lifespan of Social Security because they’re — they have a job. They’re paying the Social Security tax. That’s what they’re doing. It’s increased the lifespan. They would do the same thing in terms of reducing the overall cost of health care by them being able to be treated and not wait until they’re in extremis.\" So all candidates raised their hands affirming they’d have a plan that would offer coverage for immigrants in the country illegally. But the question did not directly ask if coverage would be free. Buttigieg specifically said people would buy the coverage, and that it was \"not about a handout.\" Biden in his answer spoke about the contributions of immigrants in the country illegally — and said that if they had health care coverage, they’d be reducing the cost of the overall health care system. A Trump re-election campaign ad said Democratic presidential candidates \"support giving illegal immigrants free healthcare at our expense.\" This is misleading. The claim is based on a raise-your-hand type of question in a June debate. Candidates were asked if their health care plans would provide coverage for immigrants in the country illegally. '), Document(metadata={'url': 'https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/biden-undocumented-healthcare/', 'context_before': 'In 2019, Biden said anyone who needs health care, “whether they’re documented or undocumented, we have an obligation to see that they’re cared for.” So-called \"undocumented\" individuals already receive emergency care, treatment from federally-subsidized health centers, and varying degrees of coverage from states. However, Biden did not call for taxpayers to pay for undocumented immigrants\\' health care. But he has said undocumented immigrants should be permitted to pay out-of-pocket for unsubsidized insurance coverage through the Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplace. In June and July 2020, ahead of the presidential elections, Democratic candidate Joe Biden’s various policy platforms were picked apart and in some cases misrepresented by critics, including U.S. President Donald Trump. One particular statement Biden made about health care for so-called \"undocumented\" immigrants was misreported and presented without context as his policy. Snopes readers asked us if Biden had ever said that U.S. taxpayers had an “obligation” to pay for the health care of 11 million \"illegal immigrants.\" We found that Biden was misquoted, and his actual platform said something very different. The quote appeared to originate from a clip shared by right-wing media organization BlazeTV, in May 2019. The video carried the title, \"Joe Biden Says U.S. Obligated to Give Free Healthcare to \\'Undocumented\\' Immigrants.\" In the clip, a reporter asked Biden, “Do you think the undocumented immigrants…[that] are law abiding, should be entitled to federal benefits, Medicare, Medicaid for example?” \"Look I think that anyone who is in a situation where they’re in need of healthcare, regardless of whether they’re documented or undocumented, we have an obligation to see that they’re cared for. That’s why I think we need more clinics around the country.\" ', 'context_after': ''}, page_content='Biden echoed this in the June 2019 Democratic presidential debates. And in a December 2019 interview with Telemundo, he laid out the caveats in his plan: \"They can buy into the system like everyone else\" under the Affordable Care Act (ACA). On July 14, 2020, in a rambling speech, Trump misrepresented Biden\\'s policy after it was presented by the Biden-Sanders Unity Task Forces. Trump said: “They want government health care for all illegal aliens.” But here\\'s what the task force actually recommended: \"To ensure that people living and working across the country have health care access, the Task Force recommends extending Affordable Care Act coverage to DACA recipients, allowing undocumented immigrants to purchase unsubsidized coverage in the ACA marketplaces ...\" Under this proposal, taxpayers would not be paying for undocumented immigrants’ health care, rather undocumented immigrants could have the option to pay out-of-pocket for health coverage through the ACA exchange marketplace, but without access to the government subsidies that are available to others. In 2019 Brookings estimated that there are 10.5 to 12 million undocumented immigrants in the U.S. Currently, they cannot enroll in Medicaid, the Children\\'s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), or purchase insurance through the ACA marketplace. Some state-funded or locally-funded health programs provide coverage regardless of immigration status. Emergency health services and safety-net clinics are already available to undocumented immigrants, which Biden had advocated for before. In summary, even though Biden did state that the U.S. had an obligation to ensure immigrants received health care, his views were largely misrepresented and did not reflect his current policy.
