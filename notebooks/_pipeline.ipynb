Finance Minister Patrick Chinamasa promised in a budget speech last week to re-engage with international lenders, curb spending and attract investors to revive the economy. '}, page_content='The African Export and Import Bank has pledged up to $1.5 billion in new loans and financial guarantees to Zimbabwe in a major boost for new President Emmerson Mnangagwa\\'s government, the bank\\'s president and chairman said Tuesday. Mnangagwa, who took over last month after veteran autocrat Robert Mugabe quit following a de facto military coup, has vowed to focus on reviving the struggling economy and provide jobs in a nation with an unemployment rate exceeding 80 percent. Afreximbank was the only international lender that stood by Zimbabwe throughout Mugabe\\'s repressive 37-year rule, but its quick announcement of a fresh package of loans and guarantees appeared to be a vote of confidence in the new government. Cairo-based Afreximbank was a major funder of Zimbabwe while the country was cut off from the International Monetary Fund and World Bank for having defaulted on its debt in 1999. Bank president and chairman Okey Oramah told reporters after a meeting with Mnangagwa and senior government officials that Afreximbank would provide $150 million to local banks to help them pay for outstanding critical imports. \"We also discussed a number of other areas that involve additional investment from us for something that will be in the order of $1 billion to $1.5 billion that will include certain kinds of guarantees to encourage investors to come to Zimbabwe. \"We ... want to make sure that we support the stabilization of the economy, that means providing liquidity to make sure that the situation where people are rushing every time to look for cash is dealt with,\" Oramah said. In August, before Mugabe\\'s ouster, Afreximbank provided $600 million to help Zimbabwe pay for imports and $300 million to allow it to print more \"bond notes,\" a quasi-currency that officially trades on par with the U.S. dollar. Zimbabwe has a foreign debt of more than $7 billion and in September said it would not be able to pay $1.8 billion in arrears to the World Bank and African Development Bank until economic fundamentals improved.

The Afreximbank Trade Debt-backed Securities (AFTRADES) will be provided to participating banks as debt securities that could be used as collateral for interbank funds placements in order to promote interbank dealings among Zimbabwean Banks active in trade finance, according to the terms of a memorandum of understanding signed on by Afreximbank, the Zimbabwe Ministry of Finance and Economic Development and the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe. “Our objective is to use this facility to enable trade finance banks in Zimbabwe to access much-needed liquidity from cash-surplus banks in the country, thereby increasing their capacity to deepen their trade finance activities,” said Jean-Louis Ekra, President of Afreximbank, after signing the memorandum of understanding in Cairo on 10 February. Patrick Chinamasa, Minister of Finance and Economic Planning, and Dr. Charity L. Dhliwayo, Acting Governor of the Reserve Bank, had signed it on 31 January on behalf of the Zimbabwean parties. Mr. Ekra said that Afreximbank’s decision to introduce the facility was motivated by its recognition of the serious constraints limiting the access of Zimbabwe’s trade finance banks to funding as a result of the liquidity challenge confronting the financial sector. Under the terms of the memorandum of understanding, AFTRADES would be structured as a collateral swap involving the issuance of securities by Afreximbank to participating banks in exchange for trade–related collateral or securities presented by those banks. \\nThe Government of Zimbabwe, through the Ministry of Finance and Economic Development, will serve as the facility’s guarantor and liquidity support contributor, up to agreed levels, while the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe will grant the regulatory approvals required by the participating banks. In addition, the Reserve Bank will provide the infrastructure required for the implementation and administration of the facility. Only solvent banks which are not facing fundamental problems of viability will be eligible for the facility, according to the memorandum. The African Export Import Bank was established in October 1993 by African governments, African private and institutional investors, and non-African investors to finance and promote intra- and extra-African trade. Its two basic constitutive documents are the Establishment Agreement, which gives it the status of an international organization, and the Charter, which governs its corporate structure and operations. Since 1994, the Bank has approved more than $25 billion in credit facilities in support of African trade, including $3.71 billion in 2012. \\n'), Evidence(question=\"What percentage of Afreximbank's total loans does the amount provided to Zimbabwe represent?\", answer='The loans provided to Zimbabwe ($2.1 billion) represent approximately 4.1% of the total loans provided by Afreximbank ($51 billion).', url='https://www.centralbanking.com/central-banks/reserves/foreign-exchange/4072761/zimbabwe-borrows-985-million-from-pan-african-lenders', scraped_text='\\nZimbabwe borrows $985 million from pan-African lenders The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) has borrowed $985 million from pan-African lending institutions to cover import of basic products, governor John Mangudya told the country’s parliament on March 4.

ANOVA analysis is used to analyze the group effect. The p value is less than 2e-16 for the log 2 transformed case comparison, suggesting that the two groups are statistically significantly different. The Asian mask-wearing group clearly has lower growth rates of COVID-19 cases compared to the non-mask-wearing group. Thailand has the highest growth rate among the mask-wearing groups. However, the differences in the growth rate of confirmed cases between these two groups cannot be fully attributed to mask-wearing, but arise from many factors, such as clinical tests performed, complicated social, economic, and cultural differences, and varied public health polices enforcement. The preliminary comparison only provides the rationale to further evaluate if wearing masks is effective for controlling the infectious disease outbreak. Our study has six major assumptions with preliminary evidence. First, the SARS-CoV-2 transmission pathway includes airborne [1, 8, 22–24] with an R0 value exceeding that of influenza and SARS [16, 32, 33]. Second, a proportion of infected cases could be asymptomatic [36, 38, 46, 47]. Third, asymptomatic individuals could transfer the virus in the community [48, 49, 82]. Fourth, the public awareness of mask usage may increase as the pandemic spreads [64]. Fifth, the market could respond to consumer demand with a production increase and without supply chain problems [67]. Sixth, homemade cloth masks are not as effective as commercial medical masks [57, 60]. Thus, we project the best scenario as the pandemic spreads and by the end of the outbreak, the general population will be willing to wear a mask. Although wearing a mask is a low-cost and non-disruptive measure, wearing a mask has not been culturally widespread in many parts of the world [83]. Furthermore, for non-certified medical masks, individual errors could lead to ineffective mask fitting, which could reduce the benefit of wearing a mask [84]. \\nThere are limitations to those six assumptions. First, a recent study suggested that the virus was detected on the outer layer of COVID-19 patients' masks [85], which could invalidate the utility of a patient wearing a mask. However, although the virus was detected, the mask could still provide prevention by reducing the virus load to an adjacent healthy individual. Further studies on asymptomatic individuals wearing masks could be more convincing to validate the effectiveness of wearing a mask to prevent pre-symptomatic transmission. Second, we assume random mixing and model the general population, but have not taken account children's role. Children are less likely to wear masks consistently to realize mask effectiveness. At the same time, the role of children in COVID-19 transmission is unclear [86]. Third, we assume the willing individual who has a mask can use the mask in the right manner and follow social distancing and other personal hygiene practices. There are discrepancies between willingness, perceived compliance, and real compliance [87]. Fourth, research shows that masks can be a source of contamination if not disposed of or replaced in timely manner The COVID-19 pandemic has created a global crisis. Prevention such as vaccines is one of the most effective measures to mitigate such a catastrophic public health crisis. Prior to an available vaccine, NPIs such as wearing a mask can potentially reduce the virus transmission rate. Recent modeling studies suggest that timely and comprehensive NPIs are needed to prevent a secondary wave of COVID-19 [89]. However, timely implementations of NPI such as wearing a mask call for public awareness, a readily available market stockpile, and government advocacy and policies. For respiratory diseases caused by a rival agent through aerosol and droplet transmission routes, wearing masks could be a reasonable NPI to reduce the virus transmission efficiency and secondary transmission [5, 89]. \\nHowever, masks do not replace social distancing and other personal hygiene practices, such as hand washing. The effectiveness of any NPIs depends on compliance rates, contact rate reduction, the role of children, and asymptomatic cases in transmission. Our model analyzes the impact of wearing a mask that can efficiently filter viral aerosols during the COVID-19 pandemic in the general population. Our study suggests that wearing a quality mask in combination with other NPIs can support hospital resource management during a pandemic. In a free market, the risks of not having enough masks for the general population may negatively impact timely responses to the outbreak. Appropriate public health policies and government subsidies could be necessary to manage similar crises in the future. Future studies on how to improve adherence and compliance rates will better position society for potential future respiratory disease outbreaks when the viral agent has a similar clinical attack rate. - 1.

Furthermore, the widespread use of disposable masks has led to shortage of filter materials and problems with their haphazard disposal. In this study, a testing system that is based on standardized methods has been established and enhanced to reliably measure the particle filtration efficiency (PFE) of masks. Quality control experiments that examine the filtration efficiency of polystyrene latex (PSL) particles that are 0.1 µm in size and sodium chloride (NaCl) particles that range from 0.01–1.0 µm are conducted to determine the reliability of the testing system. Moreover, various textile materials are tested to fabricate 3-layer face masks, and the PFE of these masks is tested by using the proposed testing system to find the most suitable materials and the likelihood of their reusability. Among the tested materials, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) used as the membrane in the filter layer has the highest PFE of 88.33% ± 1.80%, which is mainly due to its dense and multilayer structure. The air permeability of the self-developed masks ranges from 1.41 ± 0.04 to 1.93 ± 0.08, less breathable than the commercial masks. The reusability of a mask that uses PTFE as the membrane in the filter layer is tested by gently washing the mask 30 times and then drying the mask in air before the PFE is measured. The PFE is only reduced by 10–20% after 30 washes, thus indicating the potential reusability of the mask. The findings in this study will contribute to reducing the pressure of mask shortages and are an environmentally friendly solution to the massive use of disposable masks. Keywords: COVID-19; Mask testing system; Reusable mask; Particle filtration efficiency. The new coronavirus (COVID-19) has become a global public health concern because it is highly contagious with severe or even fatal health consequences. With the rapid spread of COVID-19, self-protection has become crucial to avoid contracting this disease. \\nAs a highly infectious disease, the two main routes of transmission include direct transmission (e.g., spraying droplets emitted from aerosolized particles through sneezing, coughing or talking), and indirect transmission (contact with surfaces that contain the virus or objects that have been in contact with an infected individual) (Liu, 2020; Ningthoujam, 2020; Tomar and Gupta, 2020). However, the former has been documented to be a more prevalent form of transmission, so an effective mask must be worn to obstruct the transmission of the virus and block its spread when conducting daily life activities (Bałazy et al., 2006; MacIntyre and Chughtai, 2020). This has led to the unprecedented demand and shortage of masks, along with the problem of ineffective masks. On the one hand, there are a variety of different masks on the market. Although most commercially available masks claim effectiveness against contact with airborne particles, their actual performance has not been tested adequately. For example, Cheng (2020) reported that there was no quality control in face mask production in Pakistan. In Italy, in order to meet the huge demand of face masks, some industries have reset the production chain, shifting from the usual target products to the production of masks. However, the quality of the masks is questionable and needs to be tested (Amendola et al., 2020). In addition, Lam et al. (2020) examined 160 mask brands on the market and found that 48.8% of them were substandard and/or invalid. With COVID-19 as an urgent public health issue now, it has become imperative to test and validate the performance of these masks with reliable testing equipment. On the other hand, COVID-19 has led to the unprecedented demand for masks, which has resulted in a shortage of materials to fabricate them. Moreover, most of the masks currently found on the market are disposable (i.e., surgical, N95 and KF94 masks). \\nThe widespread use of such disposable masks is having a detrimental effect on the environment, as additional resources and human resources are needed to properly dispose of used masks which might otherwise end up in the oceans or landfills. As such, it is timely to develop effective yet reusable masks, not only to address the needs of the current epidemic but also to conserve resources. One of the key parameters of masks is their particle filtration efficiency (PFE) which reflects the ability of masks and/or filters to block the inhalation of different types of particles. Basically, PFE testing follows the methods stipulated in various standards, which include ASTM F2299 (the United States) and YY 0469-2011/GB19083-2010 (Chinese), and the standard provided by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). In ASTM F2299, polystyrene latex (PSL) particles of a specific size are used to evaluate the PFE of a material. Although the applicable particle size range is from 0.1 µm to 5.0 µm, PSL particles of 0.1 µm are generally used for testing as it is the most penetrating particle size. In YY 0469-2011, sodium chloride (NaCl) particles that range from 0.01 µm to 1.0 µm are used as the index in PFE testing of masks, while the NIOSH standard is used to test masks to filter NaCl particles that are 0.3 µm in size. Although these standard methods provide basic instructions and parameters for PFE testing, they do not offer specific settings for testing systems and details of the equipment involved. Moreover, some of the standard methods have limitations. For instance, a device that is recommended for measuring particle concentration (an optical particle counter (OPC)) is low in accuracy and size-resolution (Rengasamy et al., 2011). Moreover, the standards do not strictly stipulate the size of the particles to be tested, thus resulting in differences and uncertainties in the results with the different testing agents and systems.

The impact of this breakthrough seems almost too good to be true. We have found a disease control tool that, when used properly, can dramatically reduce the person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Studies have shown that this tool could reduce transmission by somewhere between 50% and 85%. The tool is cheap and remarkably low-tech. You can even make one at home. It has no significant side effects. And with each passing day, the scientific research showing the tool’s effectiveness gets stronger and stronger. If this tool were a vaccine or medicine, we’d be high-fiving each other and popping the champagne, knowing we’d discovered a crucial means to help prevent the spread of the pandemic. I’m talking, of course, about face masks—cloth, surgical, or even a bandanna. Face masks block the spread of respiratory droplets that can carry the novel coronavirus. But just as with so many other aspects of the response to COVID-19—including mass testing, contact tracing, and the early use of stay-at-home orders—the U.S. is once again squandering this opportunity. In many countries that have so far successfully controlled their COVID-19 epidemics, public health leaders, politicians, and the public have fully embraced the use of face masks with no hint of controversy. A recent study found that countries where masks were widely used soon after their COVID-19 outbreak began were more likely to keep their death rates low and to have a shorter outbreak. Countries like Hong Kong, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam that quickly adopted masking, along with other control measures such as social distancing and track and trace, have reported fewer than 6 deaths per million residents as a result of COVID-19. Yet in the U.S., where the death rate from COVID-19 is now 379 per million people, face masks have been weaponized for partisan purposes. \\nTaking their cues from President Trump, who has refused to appear on camera wearing a face mask and has said that Americans who wear masks are doing so to show their disapproval of him, many of his supporters now see wearing a face mask as an affront to personal liberty. According to the Washington Post, Republican leaders “are less likely to mandate them, and Republican voters are more likely to forgo, and even scorn, them.” Health officials who have promoted mask mandates have quit their jobs after receiving death threats. As a result of this alarming polarization, only 18 states and the District of Columbia are mandating face masks in public across the whole state. Only two—Massachusetts and Maryland—have Republican governors. Meanwhile, many Republican-led states are actively trying to subvert local measures. Nebraska Governor Pete Ricketts has gone so far as to say he will withhold federal coronavirus relief funds from local governments if they try and mandate mask use in their places of work. Rejecting face masks inevitably means embracing more COVID-19 cases and deaths. One U.S. study found that states with a mandate had a more rapid decline in daily growth rates of COVID-19 and estimated that mask use prevented up to 450,000 cases of COVID-19 by May 22, 2020. And while researchers at the University of Washington now predict that the U.S. could reach 180,000 COVID-19 deaths by October, they say we could prevent 33,000 of these deaths—more than half of the new deaths the model projects—if at least 95% of people wear a mask. That’s right. We can avert the deaths of 33,000 of our parents, grandparents, siblings, co-workers, teachers, bus drivers, mail carriers, nurses and store and factory workers by just sticking a one-dollar piece of cloth over our noses and mouths. So what’s stopping us? One problem is the “me first” culture in the U.S., in which anti-maskers claim that their right to go around unmasked in public matters more than saving lives.

Despite the current limited scientific data detailing their effectiveness, we support the wearing of face coverings by the public when mandated and when in close contact with people whose infection  status they don't know. However, we also encourage everyone to continue to limit their time spent  indoors near potentially infectious people and to not count on or expect a cloth mask or face  covering to protect them or the people around them. The pandemic is not over and will not likely be  over for some time. As states and local jurisdictions reopen, we encourage people to continue to  assess and limit their risks. Cloth masks and face coverings likely do not offer the same degree of  protection as physical distancing, isolation, or limiting personal contact time.  Will face coverings 'flatten the curve' and stop the pandemic?  We have reviewed the many modeling studies that purport to demonstrate that cloth masks or face  coverings have the potential for flattening the curve or significantly decrease the number of cases. These studies fail to recognize several important facts:  • The filter performance of a cloth material does not directly translate or represent its performance on an individual, because it neglects the understanding of fit.  • Cloth masks or coverings come in a variety of shapes, sizes, and materials and are not made  • Transmission is not simply a function of short random interactions between individuals, but  rather a function of particle concentration in the air and the time exposed to that concentration.  • A cloth mask or face covering does very little to prevent the emission or inhalation of small  particles. As discussed in an earlier CIDRAP commenta1y_(http, ://www.cidrap.umn.edu/n ws- perspective/2.020/03/commentary-covid-19-transmission-messages-should-l1inge-science)_and more recently by \\nMorawska and Milton (2020) in an open letter to WHO signed by 239 scientists, inhalation of  https://www.cidrap. umn. ed u/news-perspective/2020/04/commenta ry-masks-all-covid-19-not-based-sound-data ? COMMENTARY: Masks-for-all for COVID-19 not based on sound data I CIDRAP  small infectious particles is not only biologically plausible, but the epidemiology supports it as an important mode of transmission for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.  In summary, though we support mask wearing by the general public, we continue to conclude that  cloth masks and face coverings are likely to have limited impact on lowering COVID-19  transmission, because they have minimal ability to prevent the emission of small particles, offer  limited personal protection with respect to small particle inhalation, and should not be  recommended as a replacement for physical distancing or reducing time in enclosed spaces with  many potentially infectious people. We are very concerned about messaging that suggests cloth  masks or face coverings can replace physical distancing. We also worry that the public doesn't  understand the limitations of cloth masks and face coverings when we observe how many people  wear their mask under their nose or even under their mouth, remove their masks when talking to  someone nearby, or fail to practice physical distancing when wearing a mask.

In one corner, we have scientists, epidemiologists, infectious-disease physicians, clinicians, engineers—many different experts in the medical community, that is—arguing that the spread of COVID-19 by aerosols (that is, tiny droplets that can remain airborne long enough to travel significantly farther than the six-foot separation we’ve been told to observe) is both real and dangerous. In the other, it’s the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO), which until veryrecently have allowed only that aerosol spread is possible, not necessarily likely. And while watching experts going against governmental agencies isn’t always riveting stuff, this particular battle is terribly important. It has significant implications for how we as a country handle this epidemic, and what decisions we make going forward—and those decisions need to be made sooner, not later. On some level, this is a discussion of droplets versus aerosols. You’ve probably heard plenty this year about droplets: they’re larger in size and may be exhaled by someone talking, shouting, singing, coughing or sneezing. These droplets don’t travel far and fall quickly to the ground, one reason why a “social distance” of roughly six feet is seen as a safe one.

By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today. Aerosols, on the other hand, are tiny by comparison, nearly 10,000 times smaller than a human hair. They’re spread at far greater distances—20 to 30 feet—and can linger in the air for minutes to hours, infecting others. What constitutes a safe distance from aerosols is much harder to define, especially in crowded indoor spaces with poor ventilation. \\nChoosing a safe mask becomes difficult as well: an N95 respirator, for example, would be preferable to an ill-fitting cloth mask when it comes to filtering out these minuscule viral aerosols. For these and other reasons, some in the medical community suspect, our health agencies have been reluctant to accept the data on the airborne transmission of COVID-19—because if they do, they’re acknowledging a problem far more challenging even than what we’ve been dealt with so far. This reluctance has prompted an epic response. In a nearly unprecedented move, 239 scientists from 32 countries wrote an open letter to the WHO in July, urging the agency to recognize that airborne transmission of coronavirus by smaller aerosol particles is possible. The organization’s response was to subsequently update its position, stating that aerosol transmission “cannot be ruled out.” A glowing endorsement this was not—although, points out a spokesperson for the organization, “We have substantial guidance on the topic and speak repeatedly in press conferences and other venues about the importance of keeping indoor spaces well ventilated, precisely because of the potential of aerosol transmission in these settings. WHO has advice in the form of Q&As for the general public, and for people who manage public spaces and buildings and health facilities.” The CDC, meanwhile, posted on its Web site over the weekend that aerosolization may be “the main way the virus spreads,” then backtracked and removed the content from its site, claiming the language had been a draft of some proposed changes which were “posted in error.” This is a major point, not a minor one. Aerosol carry of the virus means that any indoor area where people gather in numbers—think restaurants, bars, churches, schools, rallies—is potentially a spreader of the disease, and depending upon the numbers, a superspreader. These are likely places with poor ventilation, where people not only are close together but may be speaking loudly, shouting, singing, cheering or booing, etc. \\nThe idea of aerosol spread is neither new nor controversial. Several diseases, including measles, chickenpox and tuberculosis, have been shown to be transmitted by aerosols. Patients sick with the flu have the virus in their exhaled breath, and that virus has been shown to be present in the air. This is true for some other viruses, including those found in infants. Scientists in Wuhan, China, have identified coronavirus RNA particles in the air in hospital areas, although they haven’t yet proven that the particles are infectious. Lab workers at the University of Nebraska have published their finding that they, too, have identified coronavirus RNA in the air. “We have pretty strong circumstantial evidence, in a number of these superspreading indoor incidents, that there must have been a significant component of aerosol or airborne transmission,” says William Bahnfleth, chair of the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) Epidemic Task Force. Bahnfleth noted several examples, including a restaurant in Guangzhou, China, where multiple people without direct contact with one another became infected from a single individual, and a choir practice in Washington state where presumed droplet and aerosol spread from singingsickened 53 people, two of whom died. In an e-mail interview, researcher Bjorn Birnir shared his work, published in a preprint (a non–peer reviewed paper), that demonstrated how an infected person continues to exhale a cloud of droplets and aerosols. These “build up over time to dangerous concentrations for everyone in the room,” Birnir says. While we don’t know exactly how much virus is needed to infect people or at what concentrations, these examples show that at some point the threshold is met and inhaled aerosols are the likely culprits. “Aerosol transmission plays a significant role in indoor environments and cannot be neglected,” says environmental science expert Maosheng Yao, a professor of engineering at Peking University. \"), Evidence(question='What are the limitations of cloth masks in preventing COVID-19 transmission?', answer='Cloth masks have minimal ability to prevent the emission or inhalation of small particles and should not replace physical distancing.', url='https://aaqr.org/articles/aaqr-20-06-covid-0275', scraped_text='The unprecedented demand for masks has now attracted attention on their filtration efficiency.

Keywords: COVID-19; Mask testing system; Reusable mask; Particle filtration efficiency. The new coronavirus (COVID-19) has become a global public health concern because it is highly contagious with severe or even fatal health consequences. With the rapid spread of COVID-19, self-protection has become crucial to avoid contracting this disease. \\nAs a highly infectious disease, the two main routes of transmission include direct transmission (e.g., spraying droplets emitted from aerosolized particles through sneezing, coughing or talking), and indirect transmission (contact with surfaces that contain the virus or objects that have been in contact with an infected individual) (Liu, 2020; Ningthoujam, 2020; Tomar and Gupta, 2020). However, the former has been documented to be a more prevalent form of transmission, so an effective mask must be worn to obstruct the transmission of the virus and block its spread when conducting daily life activities (Bałazy et al., 2006; MacIntyre and Chughtai, 2020). This has led to the unprecedented demand and shortage of masks, along with the problem of ineffective masks. On the one hand, there are a variety of different masks on the market. Although most commercially available masks claim effectiveness against contact with airborne particles, their actual performance has not been tested adequately. For example, Cheng (2020) reported that there was no quality control in face mask production in Pakistan. In Italy, in order to meet the huge demand of face masks, some industries have reset the production chain, shifting from the usual target products to the production of masks. However, the quality of the masks is questionable and needs to be tested (Amendola et al., 2020). In addition, Lam et al. (2020) examined 160 mask brands on the market and found that 48.8% of them were substandard and/or invalid. With COVID-19 as an urgent public health issue now, it has become imperative to test and validate the performance of these masks with reliable testing equipment. On the other hand, COVID-19 has led to the unprecedented demand for masks, which has resulted in a shortage of materials to fabricate them. Moreover, most of the masks currently found on the market are disposable (i.e., surgical, N95 and KF94 masks). \\nThe widespread use of such disposable masks is having a detrimental effect on the environment, as additional resources and human resources are needed to properly dispose of used masks which might otherwise end up in the oceans or landfills. As such, it is timely to develop effective yet reusable masks, not only to address the needs of the current epidemic but also to conserve resources. One of the key parameters of masks is their particle filtration efficiency (PFE) which reflects the ability of masks and/or filters to block the inhalation of different types of particles. Basically, PFE testing follows the methods stipulated in various standards, which include ASTM F2299 (the United States) and YY 0469-2011/GB19083-2010 (Chinese), and the standard provided by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). In ASTM F2299, polystyrene latex (PSL) particles of a specific size are used to evaluate the PFE of a material. Although the applicable particle size range is from 0.1 µm to 5.0 µm, PSL particles of 0.1 µm are generally used for testing as it is the most penetrating particle size. In YY 0469-2011, sodium chloride (NaCl) particles that range from 0.01 µm to 1.0 µm are used as the index in PFE testing of masks, while the NIOSH standard is used to test masks to filter NaCl particles that are 0.3 µm in size. Although these standard methods provide basic instructions and parameters for PFE testing, they do not offer specific settings for testing systems and details of the equipment involved. Moreover, some of the standard methods have limitations. For instance, a device that is recommended for measuring particle concentration (an optical particle counter (OPC)) is low in accuracy and size-resolution (Rengasamy et al., 2011). Moreover, the standards do not strictly stipulate the size of the particles to be tested, thus resulting in differences and uncertainties in the results with the different testing agents and systems.

ANOVA analysis is used to analyze the group effect. The p value is less than 2e-16 for the log 2 transformed case comparison, suggesting that the two groups are statistically significantly different. The Asian mask-wearing group clearly has lower growth rates of COVID-19 cases compared to the non-mask-wearing group. Thailand has the highest growth rate among the mask-wearing groups. However, the differences in the growth rate of confirmed cases between these two groups cannot be fully attributed to mask-wearing, but arise from many factors, such as clinical tests performed, complicated social, economic, and cultural differences, and varied public health polices enforcement. The preliminary comparison only provides the rationale to further evaluate if wearing masks is effective for controlling the infectious disease outbreak. Our study has six major assumptions with preliminary evidence. First, the SARS-CoV-2 transmission pathway includes airborne [1, 8, 22–24] with an R0 value exceeding that of influenza and SARS [16, 32, 33]. Second, a proportion of infected cases could be asymptomatic [36, 38, 46, 47]. Third, asymptomatic individuals could transfer the virus in the community [48, 49, 82]. Fourth, the public awareness of mask usage may increase as the pandemic spreads [64]. Fifth, the market could respond to consumer demand with a production increase and without supply chain problems [67]. Sixth, homemade cloth masks are not as effective as commercial medical masks [57, 60]. Thus, we project the best scenario as the pandemic spreads and by the end of the outbreak, the general population will be willing to wear a mask. Although wearing a mask is a low-cost and non-disruptive measure, wearing a mask has not been culturally widespread in many parts of the world [83]. Furthermore, for non-certified medical masks, individual errors could lead to ineffective mask fitting, which could reduce the benefit of wearing a mask [84]. \\nThere are limitations to those six assumptions. First, a recent study suggested that the virus was detected on the outer layer of COVID-19 patients' masks [85], which could invalidate the utility of a patient wearing a mask. However, although the virus was detected, the mask could still provide prevention by reducing the virus load to an adjacent healthy individual. Further studies on asymptomatic individuals wearing masks could be more convincing to validate the effectiveness of wearing a mask to prevent pre-symptomatic transmission. Second, we assume random mixing and model the general population, but have not taken account children's role. Children are less likely to wear masks consistently to realize mask effectiveness. At the same time, the role of children in COVID-19 transmission is unclear [86]. Third, we assume the willing individual who has a mask can use the mask in the right manner and follow social distancing and other personal hygiene practices. There are discrepancies between willingness, perceived compliance, and real compliance [87]. Fourth, research shows that masks can be a source of contamination if not disposed of or replaced in timely manner The COVID-19 pandemic has created a global crisis. Prevention such as vaccines is one of the most effective measures to mitigate such a catastrophic public health crisis. Prior to an available vaccine, NPIs such as wearing a mask can potentially reduce the virus transmission rate. Recent modeling studies suggest that timely and comprehensive NPIs are needed to prevent a secondary wave of COVID-19 [89]. However, timely implementations of NPI such as wearing a mask call for public awareness, a readily available market stockpile, and government advocacy and policies. For respiratory diseases caused by a rival agent through aerosol and droplet transmission routes, wearing masks could be a reasonable NPI to reduce the virus transmission efficiency and secondary transmission [5, 89]. \\nHowever, masks do not replace social distancing and other personal hygiene practices, such as hand washing. The effectiveness of any NPIs depends on compliance rates, contact rate reduction, the role of children, and asymptomatic cases in transmission. Our model analyzes the impact of wearing a mask that can efficiently filter viral aerosols during the COVID-19 pandemic in the general population. Our study suggests that wearing a quality mask in combination with other NPIs can support hospital resource management during a pandemic. In a free market, the risks of not having enough masks for the general population may negatively impact timely responses to the outbreak. Appropriate public health policies and government subsidies could be necessary to manage similar crises in the future. Future studies on how to improve adherence and compliance rates will better position society for potential future respiratory disease outbreaks when the viral agent has a similar clinical attack rate. - 1.

Despite the current limited scientific data detailing their effectiveness, we support the wearing of face coverings by the public when mandated and when in close contact with people whose infection  status they don't know. However, we also encourage everyone to continue to limit their time spent  indoors near potentially infectious people and to not count on or expect a cloth mask or face  covering to protect them or the people around them. The pandemic is not over and will not likely be  over for some time. As states and local jurisdictions reopen, we encourage people to continue to  assess and limit their risks. Cloth masks and face coverings likely do not offer the same degree of  protection as physical distancing, isolation, or limiting personal contact time.  Will face coverings 'flatten the curve' and stop the pandemic?  We have reviewed the many modeling studies that purport to demonstrate that cloth masks or face  coverings have the potential for flattening the curve or significantly decrease the number of cases. These studies fail to recognize several important facts:  • The filter performance of a cloth material does not directly translate or represent its performance on an individual, because it neglects the understanding of fit.  • Cloth masks or coverings come in a variety of shapes, sizes, and materials and are not made  • Transmission is not simply a function of short random interactions between individuals, but  rather a function of particle concentration in the air and the time exposed to that concentration.  • A cloth mask or face covering does very little to prevent the emission or inhalation of small  particles.

In summary, though we support mask wearing by the general public, we continue to conclude that  cloth masks and face coverings are likely to have limited impact on lowering COVID-19  transmission, because they have minimal ability to prevent the emission of small particles, offer  limited personal protection with respect to small particle inhalation, and should not be  recommended as a replacement for physical distancing or reducing time in enclosed spaces with  many potentially infectious people. We are very concerned about messaging that suggests cloth  masks or face coverings can replace physical distancing. We also worry that the public doesn't  understand the limitations of cloth masks and face coverings when we observe how many people  wear their mask under their nose or even under their mouth, remove their masks when talking to  someone nearby, or fail to practice physical distancing when wearing a mask.

In one corner, we have scientists, epidemiologists, infectious-disease physicians, clinicians, engineers—many different experts in the medical community, that is—arguing that the spread of COVID-19 by aerosols (that is, tiny droplets that can remain airborne long enough to travel significantly farther than the six-foot separation we’ve been told to observe) is both real and dangerous. In the other, it’s the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO), which until veryrecently have allowed only that aerosol spread is possible, not necessarily likely. And while watching experts going against governmental agencies isn’t always riveting stuff, this particular battle is terribly important. It has significant implications for how we as a country handle this epidemic, and what decisions we make going forward—and those decisions need to be made sooner, not later. On some level, this is a discussion of droplets versus aerosols. You’ve probably heard plenty this year about droplets: they’re larger in size and may be exhaled by someone talking, shouting, singing, coughing or sneezing. These droplets don’t travel far and fall quickly to the ground, one reason why a “social distance” of roughly six feet is seen as a safe one.

By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today. Aerosols, on the other hand, are tiny by comparison, nearly 10,000 times smaller than a human hair. They’re spread at far greater distances—20 to 30 feet—and can linger in the air for minutes to hours, infecting others. What constitutes a safe distance from aerosols is much harder to define, especially in crowded indoor spaces with poor ventilation. \\nChoosing a safe mask becomes difficult as well: an N95 respirator, for example, would be preferable to an ill-fitting cloth mask when it comes to filtering out these minuscule viral aerosols. For these and other reasons, some in the medical community suspect, our health agencies have been reluctant to accept the data on the airborne transmission of COVID-19—because if they do, they’re acknowledging a problem far more challenging even than what we’ve been dealt with so far. This reluctance has prompted an epic response. In a nearly unprecedented move, 239 scientists from 32 countries wrote an open letter to the WHO in July, urging the agency to recognize that airborne transmission of coronavirus by smaller aerosol particles is possible. The organization’s response was to subsequently update its position, stating that aerosol transmission “cannot be ruled out.” A glowing endorsement this was not—although, points out a spokesperson for the organization, “We have substantial guidance on the topic and speak repeatedly in press conferences and other venues about the importance of keeping indoor spaces well ventilated, precisely because of the potential of aerosol transmission in these settings. WHO has advice in the form of Q&As for the general public, and for people who manage public spaces and buildings and health facilities.” The CDC, meanwhile, posted on its Web site over the weekend that aerosolization may be “the main way the virus spreads,” then backtracked and removed the content from its site, claiming the language had been a draft of some proposed changes which were “posted in error.” This is a major point, not a minor one. Aerosol carry of the virus means that any indoor area where people gather in numbers—think restaurants, bars, churches, schools, rallies—is potentially a spreader of the disease, and depending upon the numbers, a superspreader. These are likely places with poor ventilation, where people not only are close together but may be speaking loudly, shouting, singing, cheering or booing, etc. \\nThe idea of aerosol spread is neither new nor controversial. Several diseases, including measles, chickenpox and tuberculosis, have been shown to be transmitted by aerosols. Patients sick with the flu have the virus in their exhaled breath, and that virus has been shown to be present in the air. This is true for some other viruses, including those found in infants. Scientists in Wuhan, China, have identified coronavirus RNA particles in the air in hospital areas, although they haven’t yet proven that the particles are infectious. Lab workers at the University of Nebraska have published their finding that they, too, have identified coronavirus RNA in the air. “We have pretty strong circumstantial evidence, in a number of these superspreading indoor incidents, that there must have been a significant component of aerosol or airborne transmission,” says William Bahnfleth, chair of the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) Epidemic Task Force. Bahnfleth noted several examples, including a restaurant in Guangzhou, China, where multiple people without direct contact with one another became infected from a single individual, and a choir practice in Washington state where presumed droplet and aerosol spread from singingsickened 53 people, two of whom died. In an e-mail interview, researcher Bjorn Birnir shared his work, published in a preprint (a non–peer reviewed paper), that demonstrated how an infected person continues to exhale a cloud of droplets and aerosols. These “build up over time to dangerous concentrations for everyone in the room,” Birnir says. While we don’t know exactly how much virus is needed to infect people or at what concentrations, these examples show that at some point the threshold is met and inhaled aerosols are the likely culprits. “Aerosol transmission plays a significant role in indoor environments and cannot be neglected,” says environmental science expert Maosheng Yao, a professor of engineering at Peking University. \")], metadata={'suggested_label': array([0.3994863 , 0.05406459, 0.1469628 , 0.3994863 ]), 'llm_type': 'gpt-4o', 'llm_output': {'questions': [{'question': 'What is the effectiveness of masks in blocking respiratory droplets that can carry the novel coronavirus?', 'answer': 'Face masks can dramatically reduce the person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by blocking respiratory droplets.', 'source': '4'}, {'question': 'Do cloth masks offer the same degree of protection as physical distancing?', 'answer': 'Cloth masks likely do not offer the same degree of protection as physical distancing, isolation, or limiting personal contact time.', 'source': '1'}, {'question': 'What is the particle filtration efficiency (PFE) of masks using PTFE as the membrane in the filter layer?', 'answer': 'The PFE of masks using PTFE as the membrane in the filter layer is 88.33% ± 1.80%.', 'source': '0'}, {'question': 'What is the stance of the CDC and WHO on aerosol transmission of COVID-19?', 'answer': 'The CDC and WHO have acknowledged that aerosol transmission is possible but have been reluctant to fully accept it as a significant mode of transmission.', 'source': '2'}, {'question': 'What is the impact of mask-wearing on the growth rate of COVID-19 cases in mask-wearing versus non-mask-wearing groups?', 'answer': 'The Asian mask-wearing group has lower growth rates of COVID-19 cases compared to the non-mask-wearing group.', 'source': '3'}, {'question': 'What are the limitations of cloth masks in preventing COVID-19 transmission?', 'answer': 'Cloth masks have minimal ability to prevent the emission or inhalation of small particles and should not replace physical distancing.', 'source': '1'}, {'question': 'What is the potential reduction in COVID-19 transmission with proper mask usage?', 'answer': 'Proper mask usage could reduce COVID-19 transmission by somewhere between 50% and 85%.', 'source': '4'}, {'question': \"What are the concerns about the public's understanding of the effectiveness of cloth masks?\", 'answer': 'There is concern that the public does not understand the limitations of cloth masks, such as their minimal ability to prevent the emission or inhalation of small particles.', 'source': '1'}, {'question': 'What is the role of aerosols in the transmission of COVID-19?', 'answer': 'Aerosols can linger in the air for minutes to hours and infect others, making them a significant mode of transmission in crowded indoor spaces with poor ventilation.', 'source': '2'}, {'question': 'What is the effectiveness of homemade cloth masks compared to commercial medical masks?', 'answer': 'Homemade cloth masks are not as effective as commercial medical masks.', 'source': '3'}], 'claim_veracity': {'Supported': '2', 'Refuted': '4', 'Not Enough Evidence': '3', 'Conflicting Evidence/Cherrypicking': '4'}}}), retrieval_result=RetrievalResult(documents=[Document(metadata={'url': 'https://aaqr.org/articles/aaqr-20-06-covid-0275', 'context_before': 'The unprecedented demand for masks has now attracted attention on their filtration efficiency. Furthermore, the widespread use of disposable masks has led to shortage of filter materials and problems with their haphazard disposal. In this study, a testing system that is based on standardized methods has been established and enhanced to reliably measure the particle filtration efficiency (PFE) of masks. Quality control experiments that examine the filtration efficiency of polystyrene latex (PSL) particles that are 0.1 µm in size and sodium chloride (NaCl) particles that range from 0.01–1.0 µm are conducted to determine the reliability of the testing system. Moreover, various textile materials are tested to fabricate 3-layer face masks, and the PFE of these masks is tested by using the proposed testing system to find the most suitable materials and the likelihood of their reusability. Among the tested materials, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) used as the membrane in the filter layer has the highest PFE of 88.33% ± 1.80%, which is mainly due to its dense and multilayer structure. The air permeability of the self-developed masks ranges from 1.41 ± 0.04 to 1.93 ± 0.08, less breathable than the commercial masks. The reusability of a mask that uses PTFE as the membrane in the filter layer is tested by gently washing the mask 30 times and then drying the mask in air before the PFE is measured. The PFE is only reduced by 10–20% after 30 washes, thus indicating the potential reusability of the mask. The findings in this study will contribute to reducing the pressure of mask shortages and are an environmentally friendly solution to the massive use of disposable masks. Keywords: COVID-19; Mask testing system; Reusable mask; Particle filtration efficiency. The new coronavirus (COVID-19) has become a global public health concern because it is highly contagious with severe or even fatal health consequences. With the rapid spread of COVID-19, self-protection has become crucial to avoid contracting this disease. ', 'context_after': 'The widespread use of such disposable masks is having a detrimental effect on the environment, as additional resources and human resources are needed to properly dispose of used masks which might otherwise end up in the oceans or landfills. As such, it is timely to develop effective yet reusable masks, not only to address the needs of the current epidemic but also to conserve resources. One of the key parameters of masks is their particle filtration efficiency (PFE) which reflects the ability of masks and/or filters to block the inhalation of different types of particles. Basically, PFE testing follows the methods stipulated in various standards, which include ASTM F2299 (the United States) and YY 0469-2011/GB19083-2010 (Chinese), and the standard provided by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). In ASTM F2299, polystyrene latex (PSL) particles of a specific size are used to evaluate the PFE of a material. Although the applicable particle size range is from 0.1 µm to 5.0 µm, PSL particles of 0.1 µm are generally used for testing as it is the most penetrating particle size. In YY 0469-2011, sodium chloride (NaCl) particles that range from 0.01 µm to 1.0 µm are used as the index in PFE testing of masks, while the NIOSH standard is used to test masks to filter NaCl particles that are 0.3 µm in size. Although these standard methods provide basic instructions and parameters for PFE testing, they do not offer specific settings for testing systems and details of the equipment involved. Moreover, some of the standard methods have limitations. For instance, a device that is recommended for measuring particle concentration (an optical particle counter (OPC)) is low in accuracy and size-resolution (Rengasamy et al., 2011). Moreover, the standards do not strictly stipulate the size of the particles to be tested, thus resulting in differences and uncertainties in the results with the different testing agents and systems. '}, page_content='As a highly infectious disease, the two main routes of transmission include direct transmission (e.g., spraying droplets emitted from aerosolized particles through sneezing, coughing or talking), and indirect transmission (contact with surfaces that contain the virus or objects that have been in contact with an infected individual) (Liu, 2020; Ningthoujam, 2020; Tomar and Gupta, 2020). However, the former has been documented to be a more prevalent form of transmission, so an effective mask must be worn to obstruct the transmission of the virus and block its spread when conducting daily life activities (Bałazy et al., 2006; MacIntyre and Chughtai, 2020). This has led to the unprecedented demand and shortage of masks, along with the problem of ineffective masks. On the one hand, there are a variety of different masks on the market. Although most commercially available masks claim effectiveness against contact with airborne particles, their actual performance has not been tested adequately. For example, Cheng (2020) reported that there was no quality control in face mask production in Pakistan. In Italy, in order to meet the huge demand of face masks, some industries have reset the production chain, shifting from the usual target products to the production of masks. However, the quality of the masks is questionable and needs to be tested (Amendola et al., 2020). In addition, Lam et al. (2020) examined 160 mask brands on the market and found that 48.8% of them were substandard and/or invalid. With COVID-19 as an urgent public health issue now, it has become imperative to test and validate the performance of these masks with reliable testing equipment. On the other hand, COVID-19 has led to the unprecedented demand for masks, which has resulted in a shortage of materials to fabricate them. Moreover, most of the masks currently found on the market are disposable (i.e., surgical, N95 and KF94 masks).

Despite the current limited scientific data detailing their effectiveness, we support the wearing of face coverings by the public when mandated and when in close contact with people whose infection  status they don't know. However, we also encourage everyone to continue to limit their time spent  indoors near potentially infectious people and to not count on or expect a cloth mask or face  covering to protect them or the people around them. The pandemic is not over and will not likely be  over for some time. As states and local jurisdictions reopen, we encourage people to continue to  assess and limit their risks. Cloth masks and face coverings likely do not offer the same degree of  protection as physical distancing, isolation, or limiting personal contact time.  Will face coverings 'flatten the curve' and stop the pandemic?  We have reviewed the many modeling studies that purport to demonstrate that cloth masks or face  coverings have the potential for flattening the curve or significantly decrease the number of cases. These studies fail to recognize several important facts:  • The filter performance of a cloth material does not directly translate or represent its performance on an individual, because it neglects the understanding of fit.  • Cloth masks or coverings come in a variety of shapes, sizes, and materials and are not made  • Transmission is not simply a function of short random interactions between individuals, but  rather a function of particle concentration in the air and the time exposed to that concentration.  • A cloth mask or face covering does very little to prevent the emission or inhalation of small  particles.

In summary, though we support mask wearing by the general public, we continue to conclude that  cloth masks and face coverings are likely to have limited impact on lowering COVID-19  transmission, because they have minimal ability to prevent the emission of small particles, offer  limited personal protection with respect to small particle inhalation, and should not be  recommended as a replacement for physical distancing or reducing time in enclosed spaces with  many potentially infectious people. We are very concerned about messaging that suggests cloth  masks or face coverings can replace physical distancing. We also worry that the public doesn't  understand the limitations of cloth masks and face coverings when we observe how many people  wear their mask under their nose or even under their mouth, remove their masks when talking to  someone nearby, or fail to practice physical distancing when wearing a mask.

In one corner, we have scientists, epidemiologists, infectious-disease physicians, clinicians, engineers—many different experts in the medical community, that is—arguing that the spread of COVID-19 by aerosols (that is, tiny droplets that can remain airborne long enough to travel significantly farther than the six-foot separation we’ve been told to observe) is both real and dangerous. In the other, it’s the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO), which until veryrecently have allowed only that aerosol spread is possible, not necessarily likely. And while watching experts going against governmental agencies isn’t always riveting stuff, this particular battle is terribly important. It has significant implications for how we as a country handle this epidemic, and what decisions we make going forward—and those decisions need to be made sooner, not later. On some level, this is a discussion of droplets versus aerosols. You’ve probably heard plenty this year about droplets: they’re larger in size and may be exhaled by someone talking, shouting, singing, coughing or sneezing. These droplets don’t travel far and fall quickly to the ground, one reason why a “social distance” of roughly six feet is seen as a safe one.

Aerosols, on the other hand, are tiny by comparison, nearly 10,000 times smaller than a human hair. They’re spread at far greater distances—20 to 30 feet—and can linger in the air for minutes to hours, infecting others. What constitutes a safe distance from aerosols is much harder to define, especially in crowded indoor spaces with poor ventilation. \", 'context_after': 'The idea of aerosol spread is neither new nor controversial. Several diseases, including measles, chickenpox and tuberculosis, have been shown to be transmitted by aerosols. Patients sick with the flu have the virus in their exhaled breath, and that virus has been shown to be present in the air. This is true for some other viruses, including those found in infants. Scientists in Wuhan, China, have identified coronavirus RNA particles in the air in hospital areas, although they haven’t yet proven that the particles are infectious. Lab workers at the University of Nebraska have published their finding that they, too, have identified coronavirus RNA in the air. “We have pretty strong circumstantial evidence, in a number of these superspreading indoor incidents, that there must have been a significant component of aerosol or airborne transmission,” says William Bahnfleth, chair of the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) Epidemic Task Force. Bahnfleth noted several examples, including a restaurant in Guangzhou, China, where multiple people without direct contact with one another became infected from a single individual, and a choir practice in Washington state where presumed droplet and aerosol spread from singingsickened 53 people, two of whom died. In an e-mail interview, researcher Bjorn Birnir shared his work, published in a preprint (a non–peer reviewed paper), that demonstrated how an infected person continues to exhale a cloud of droplets and aerosols.

'}, page_content='Choosing a safe mask becomes difficult as well: an N95 respirator, for example, would be preferable to an ill-fitting cloth mask when it comes to filtering out these minuscule viral aerosols. For these and other reasons, some in the medical community suspect, our health agencies have been reluctant to accept the data on the airborne transmission of COVID-19—because if they do, they’re acknowledging a problem far more challenging even than what we’ve been dealt with so far. This reluctance has prompted an epic response. In a nearly unprecedented move, 239 scientists from 32 countries wrote an open letter to the WHO in July, urging the agency to recognize that airborne transmission of coronavirus by smaller aerosol particles is possible. The organization’s response was to subsequently update its position, stating that aerosol transmission “cannot be ruled out.” A glowing endorsement this was not—although, points out a spokesperson for the organization, “We have substantial guidance on the topic and speak repeatedly in press conferences and other venues about the importance of keeping indoor spaces well ventilated, precisely because of the potential of aerosol transmission in these settings. WHO has advice in the form of Q&As for the general public, and for people who manage public spaces and buildings and health facilities.” The CDC, meanwhile, posted on its Web site over the weekend that aerosolization may be “the main way the virus spreads,” then backtracked and removed the content from its site, claiming the language had been a draft of some proposed changes which were “posted in error.” This is a major point, not a minor one. Aerosol carry of the virus means that any indoor area where people gather in numbers—think restaurants, bars, churches, schools, rallies—is potentially a spreader of the disease, and depending upon the numbers, a superspreader. These are likely places with poor ventilation, where people not only are close together but may be speaking loudly, shouting, singing, cheering or booing, etc. '), Document(metadata={'url': 'https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0237691', 'context_before': 'A log transformed analysis is conducted to evaluate the growth rate of COVID-19 infections. ANOVA analysis is used to analyze the group effect. The p value is less than 2e-16 for the log 2 transformed case comparison, suggesting that the two groups are statistically significantly different. The Asian mask-wearing group clearly has lower growth rates of COVID-19 cases compared to the non-mask-wearing group. Thailand has the highest growth rate among the mask-wearing groups. However, the differences in the growth rate of confirmed cases between these two groups cannot be fully attributed to mask-wearing, but arise from many factors, such as clinical tests performed, complicated social, economic, and cultural differences, and varied public health polices enforcement. The preliminary comparison only provides the rationale to further evaluate if wearing masks is effective for controlling the infectious disease outbreak. Our study has six major assumptions with preliminary evidence. First, the SARS-CoV-2 transmission pathway includes airborne [1, 8, 22–24] with an R0 value exceeding that of influenza and SARS [16, 32, 33]. Second, a proportion of infected cases could be asymptomatic [36, 38, 46, 47]. Third, asymptomatic individuals could transfer the virus in the community [48, 49, 82]. Fourth, the public awareness of mask usage may increase as the pandemic spreads [64]. Fifth, the market could respond to consumer demand with a production increase and without supply chain problems [67]. Sixth, homemade cloth masks are not as effective as commercial medical masks [57, 60]. Thus, we project the best scenario as the pandemic spreads and by the end of the outbreak, the general population will be willing to wear a mask. Although wearing a mask is a low-cost and non-disruptive measure, wearing a mask has not been culturally widespread in many parts of the world [83]. Furthermore, for non-certified medical masks, individual errors could lead to ineffective mask fitting, which could reduce the benefit of wearing a mask [84]. ', 'context_after': 'However, masks do not replace social distancing and other personal hygiene practices, such as hand washing. The effectiveness of any NPIs depends on compliance rates, contact rate reduction, the role of children, and asymptomatic cases in transmission. Our model analyzes the impact of wearing a mask that can efficiently filter viral aerosols during the COVID-19 pandemic in the general population. Our study suggests that wearing a quality mask in combination with other NPIs can support hospital resource management during a pandemic. In a free market, the risks of not having enough masks for the general population may negatively impact timely responses to the outbreak. Appropriate public health policies and government subsidies could be necessary to manage similar crises in the future. Future studies on how to improve adherence and compliance rates will better position society for potential future respiratory disease outbreaks when the viral agent has a similar clinical attack rate. - 1.

First, a recent study suggested that the virus was detected on the outer layer of COVID-19 patients' masks [85], which could invalidate the utility of a patient wearing a mask. However, although the virus was detected, the mask could still provide prevention by reducing the virus load to an adjacent healthy individual. Further studies on asymptomatic individuals wearing masks could be more convincing to validate the effectiveness of wearing a mask to prevent pre-symptomatic transmission. Second, we assume random mixing and model the general population, but have not taken account children's role. Children are less likely to wear masks consistently to realize mask effectiveness. At the same time, the role of children in COVID-19 transmission is unclear [86]. Third, we assume the willing individual who has a mask can use the mask in the right manner and follow social distancing and other personal hygiene practices. There are discrepancies between willingness, perceived compliance, and real compliance [87]. Fourth, research shows that masks can be a source of contamination if not disposed of or replaced in timely manner The COVID-19 pandemic has created a global crisis. Prevention such as vaccines is one of the most effective measures to mitigate such a catastrophic public health crisis. Prior to an available vaccine, NPIs such as wearing a mask can potentially reduce the virus transmission rate. Recent modeling studies suggest that timely and comprehensive NPIs are needed to prevent a secondary wave of COVID-19 [89]. However, timely implementations of NPI such as wearing a mask call for public awareness, a readily available market stockpile, and government advocacy and policies. For respiratory diseases caused by a rival agent through aerosol and droplet transmission routes, wearing masks could be a reasonable NPI to reduce the virus transmission efficiency and secondary transmission [5, 89]. \"), Document(metadata={'url': 'https://time.com/5861295/masks-covid19-spread-fighting/', 'context_before': '', 'context_after': 'Taking their cues from President Trump, who has refused to appear on camera wearing a face mask and has said that Americans who wear masks are doing so to show their disapproval of him, many of his supporters now see wearing a face mask as an affront to personal liberty. According to the Washington Post, Republican leaders “are less likely to mandate them, and Republican voters are more likely to forgo, and even scorn, them.” Health officials who have promoted mask mandates have quit their jobs after receiving death threats. As a result of this alarming polarization, only 18 states and the District of Columbia are mandating face masks in public across the whole state. Only two—Massachusetts and Maryland—have Republican governors. Meanwhile, many Republican-led states are actively trying to subvert local measures. Nebraska Governor Pete Ricketts has gone so far as to say he will withhold federal coronavirus relief funds from local governments if they try and mandate mask use in their places of work. Rejecting face masks inevitably means embracing more COVID-19 cases and deaths. One U.S. study found that states with a mandate had a more rapid decline in daily growth rates of COVID-19 and estimated that mask use prevented up to 450,000 cases of COVID-19 by May 22, 2020. And while researchers at the University of Washington now predict that the U.S. could reach 180,000 COVID-19 deaths by October, they say we could prevent 33,000 of these deaths—more than half of the new deaths the model projects—if at least 95% of people wear a mask. That’s right. We can avert the deaths of 33,000 of our parents, grandparents, siblings, co-workers, teachers, bus drivers, mail carriers, nurses and store and factory workers by just sticking a one-dollar piece of cloth over our noses and mouths. So what’s stopping us? One problem is the “me first” culture in the U.S., in which anti-maskers claim that their right to go around unmasked in public matters more than saving lives. '}, page_content='At long last, we have made a truly game-changing scientific breakthrough in preventing the spread of COVID-19. The impact of this breakthrough seems almost too good to be true. We have found a disease control tool that, when used properly, can dramatically reduce the person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Studies have shown that this tool could reduce transmission by somewhere between 50% and 85%. The tool is cheap and remarkably low-tech. You can even make one at home. It has no significant side effects. And with each passing day, the scientific research showing the tool’s effectiveness gets stronger and stronger. If this tool were a vaccine or medicine, we’d be high-fiving each other and popping the champagne, knowing we’d discovered a crucial means to help prevent the spread of the pandemic. I’m talking, of course, about face masks—cloth, surgical, or even a bandanna. Face masks block the spread of respiratory droplets that can carry the novel coronavirus. But just as with so many other aspects of the response to COVID-19—including mass testing, contact tracing, and the early use of stay-at-home orders—the U.S. is once again squandering this opportunity. In many countries that have so far successfully controlled their COVID-19 epidemics, public health leaders, politicians, and the public have fully embraced the use of face masks with no hint of controversy. A recent study found that countries where masks were widely used soon after their COVID-19 outbreak began were more likely to keep their death rates low and to have a shorter outbreak. Countries like Hong Kong, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam that quickly adopted masking, along with other control measures such as social distancing and track and trace, have reported fewer than 6 deaths per million residents as a result of COVID-19.

       "   'scraped_text': \"A log transformed analysis is conducted to evaluate the growth rate of COVID-19 infections. ANOVA analysis is used to analyze the group effect. The p value is less than 2e-16 for the log 2 transformed case comparison, suggesting that the two groups are statistically significantly different. The Asian mask-wearing group clearly has lower growth rates of COVID-19 cases compared to the non-mask-wearing group. Thailand has the highest growth rate among the mask-wearing groups. However, the differences in the growth rate of confirmed cases between these two groups cannot be fully attributed to mask-wearing, but arise from many factors, such as clinical tests performed, complicated social, economic, and cultural differences, and varied public health polices enforcement. The preliminary comparison only provides the rationale to further evaluate if wearing masks is effective for controlling the infectious disease outbreak. Our study has six major assumptions with preliminary evidence. First, the SARS-CoV-2 transmission pathway includes airborne [1, 8, 22–24] with an R0 value exceeding that of influenza and SARS [16, 32, 33]. Second, a proportion of infected cases could be asymptomatic [36, 38, 46, 47]. Third, asymptomatic individuals could transfer the virus in the community [48, 49, 82]. Fourth, the public awareness of mask usage may increase as the pandemic spreads [64]. Fifth, the market could respond to consumer demand with a production increase and without supply chain problems [67]. Sixth, homemade cloth masks are not as effective as commercial medical masks [57, 60]. Thus, we project the best scenario as the pandemic spreads and by the end of the outbreak, the general population will be willing to wear a mask. Although wearing a mask is a low-cost and non-disruptive measure, wearing a mask has not been culturally widespread in many parts of the world [83]. Furthermore, for non-certified medical masks, individual errors could lead to ineffective mask fitting, which could reduce the benefit of wearing a mask [84]. \\nThere are limitations to those six assumptions. First, a recent study suggested that the virus was detected on the outer layer of COVID-19 patients' masks [85], which could invalidate the utility of a patient wearing a mask. However, although the virus was detected, the mask could still provide prevention by reducing the virus load to an adjacent healthy individual. Further studies on asymptomatic individuals wearing masks could be more convincing to validate the effectiveness of wearing a mask to prevent pre-symptomatic transmission. Second, we assume random mixing and model the general population, but have not taken account children's role. Children are less likely to wear masks consistently to realize mask effectiveness. At the same time, the role of children in COVID-19 transmission is unclear [86]. Third, we assume the willing individual who has a mask can use the mask in the right manner and follow social distancing and other personal hygiene practices. There are discrepancies between willingness, perceived compliance, and real compliance [87]. Fourth, research shows that masks can be a source of contamination if not disposed of or replaced in timely manner The COVID-19 pandemic has created a global crisis. Prevention such as vaccines is one of the most effective measures to mitigate such a catastrophic public health crisis. Prior to an available vaccine, NPIs such as wearing a mask can potentially reduce the virus transmission rate. Recent modeling studies suggest that timely and comprehensive NPIs are needed to prevent a secondary wave of COVID-19 [89]. However, timely implementations of NPI such as wearing a mask call for public awareness, a readily available market stockpile, and government advocacy and policies. For respiratory diseases caused by a rival agent through aerosol and droplet transmission routes, wearing masks could be a reasonable NPI to reduce the virus transmission efficiency and secondary transmission [5, 89]. \\nHowever, masks do not replace social distancing and other personal hygiene practices, such as hand washing. The effectiveness of any NPIs depends on compliance rates, contact rate reduction, the role of children, and asymptomatic cases in transmission. Our model analyzes the impact of wearing a mask that can efficiently filter viral aerosols during the COVID-19 pandemic in the general population. Our study suggests that wearing a quality mask in combination with other NPIs can support hospital resource management during a pandemic. In a free market, the risks of not having enough masks for the general population may negatively impact timely responses to the outbreak. Appropriate public health policies and government subsidies could be necessary to manage similar crises in the future. Future studies on how to improve adherence and compliance rates will better position society for potential future respiratory disease outbreaks when the viral agent has a similar clinical attack rate. - 1.

Furthermore, the widespread use of disposable masks has led to shortage of filter materials and problems with their haphazard disposal. In this study, a testing system that is based on standardized methods has been established and enhanced to reliably measure the particle filtration efficiency (PFE) of masks. Quality control experiments that examine the filtration efficiency of polystyrene latex (PSL) particles that are 0.1 µm in size and sodium chloride (NaCl) particles that range from 0.01–1.0 µm are conducted to determine the reliability of the testing system. Moreover, various textile materials are tested to fabricate 3-layer face masks, and the PFE of these masks is tested by using the proposed testing system to find the most suitable materials and the likelihood of their reusability. Among the tested materials, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) used as the membrane in the filter layer has the highest PFE of 88.33% ± 1.80%, which is mainly due to its dense and multilayer structure. The air permeability of the self-developed masks ranges from 1.41 ± 0.04 to 1.93 ± 0.08, less breathable than the commercial masks. The reusability of a mask that uses PTFE as the membrane in the filter layer is tested by gently washing the mask 30 times and then drying the mask in air before the PFE is measured. The PFE is only reduced by 10–20% after 30 washes, thus indicating the potential reusability of the mask. The findings in this study will contribute to reducing the pressure of mask shortages and are an environmentally friendly solution to the massive use of disposable masks. Keywords: COVID-19; Mask testing system; Reusable mask; Particle filtration efficiency. The new coronavirus (COVID-19) has become a global public health concern because it is highly contagious with severe or even fatal health consequences. With the rapid spread of COVID-19, self-protection has become crucial to avoid contracting this disease. \\nAs a highly infectious disease, the two main routes of transmission include direct transmission (e.g., spraying droplets emitted from aerosolized particles through sneezing, coughing or talking), and indirect transmission (contact with surfaces that contain the virus or objects that have been in contact with an infected individual) (Liu, 2020; Ningthoujam, 2020; Tomar and Gupta, 2020). However, the former has been documented to be a more prevalent form of transmission, so an effective mask must be worn to obstruct the transmission of the virus and block its spread when conducting daily life activities (Bałazy et al., 2006; MacIntyre and Chughtai, 2020). This has led to the unprecedented demand and shortage of masks, along with the problem of ineffective masks. On the one hand, there are a variety of different masks on the market. Although most commercially available masks claim effectiveness against contact with airborne particles, their actual performance has not been tested adequately. For example, Cheng (2020) reported that there was no quality control in face mask production in Pakistan. In Italy, in order to meet the huge demand of face masks, some industries have reset the production chain, shifting from the usual target products to the production of masks. However, the quality of the masks is questionable and needs to be tested (Amendola et al., 2020). In addition, Lam et al. (2020) examined 160 mask brands on the market and found that 48.8% of them were substandard and/or invalid. With COVID-19 as an urgent public health issue now, it has become imperative to test and validate the performance of these masks with reliable testing equipment. On the other hand, COVID-19 has led to the unprecedented demand for masks, which has resulted in a shortage of materials to fabricate them. Moreover, most of the masks currently found on the market are disposable (i.e., surgical, N95 and KF94 masks). \\nThe widespread use of such disposable masks is having a detrimental effect on the environment, as additional resources and human resources are needed to properly dispose of used masks which might otherwise end up in the oceans or landfills. As such, it is timely to develop effective yet reusable masks, not only to address the needs of the current epidemic but also to conserve resources. One of the key parameters of masks is their particle filtration efficiency (PFE) which reflects the ability of masks and/or filters to block the inhalation of different types of particles. Basically, PFE testing follows the methods stipulated in various standards, which include ASTM F2299 (the United States) and YY 0469-2011/GB19083-2010 (Chinese), and the standard provided by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). In ASTM F2299, polystyrene latex (PSL) particles of a specific size are used to evaluate the PFE of a material. Although the applicable particle size range is from 0.1 µm to 5.0 µm, PSL particles of 0.1 µm are generally used for testing as it is the most penetrating particle size. In YY 0469-2011, sodium chloride (NaCl) particles that range from 0.01 µm to 1.0 µm are used as the index in PFE testing of masks, while the NIOSH standard is used to test masks to filter NaCl particles that are 0.3 µm in size. Although these standard methods provide basic instructions and parameters for PFE testing, they do not offer specific settings for testing systems and details of the equipment involved. Moreover, some of the standard methods have limitations. For instance, a device that is recommended for measuring particle concentration (an optical particle counter (OPC)) is low in accuracy and size-resolution (Rengasamy et al., 2011). Moreover, the standards do not strictly stipulate the size of the particles to be tested, thus resulting in differences and uncertainties in the results with the different testing agents and systems.

       "   'scraped_text': '\\nAt long last, we have made a truly game-changing scientific breakthrough in preventing the spread of COVID-19. The impact of this breakthrough seems almost too good to be true. We have found a disease control tool that, when used properly, can dramatically reduce the person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Studies have shown that this tool could reduce transmission by somewhere between 50% and 85%. The tool is cheap and remarkably low-tech. You can even make one at home. It has no significant side effects. And with each passing day, the scientific research showing the tool’s effectiveness gets stronger and stronger. If this tool were a vaccine or medicine, we’d be high-fiving each other and popping the champagne, knowing we’d discovered a crucial means to help prevent the spread of the pandemic. I’m talking, of course, about face masks—cloth, surgical, or even a bandanna. Face masks block the spread of respiratory droplets that can carry the novel coronavirus. But just as with so many other aspects of the response to COVID-19—including mass testing, contact tracing, and the early use of stay-at-home orders—the U.S. is once again squandering this opportunity. In many countries that have so far successfully controlled their COVID-19 epidemics, public health leaders, politicians, and the public have fully embraced the use of face masks with no hint of controversy. A recent study found that countries where masks were widely used soon after their COVID-19 outbreak began were more likely to keep their death rates low and to have a shorter outbreak. Countries like Hong Kong, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam that quickly adopted masking, along with other control measures such as social distancing and track and trace, have reported fewer than 6 deaths per million residents as a result of COVID-19. Yet in the U.S., where the death rate from COVID-19 is now 379 per million people, face masks have been weaponized for partisan purposes. \\nTaking their cues from President Trump, who has refused to appear on camera wearing a face mask and has said that Americans who wear masks are doing so to show their disapproval of him, many of his supporters now see wearing a face mask as an affront to personal liberty. According to the Washington Post, Republican leaders “are less likely to mandate them, and Republican voters are more likely to forgo, and even scorn, them.” Health officials who have promoted mask mandates have quit their jobs after receiving death threats. As a result of this alarming polarization, only 18 states and the District of Columbia are mandating face masks in public across the whole state. Only two—Massachusetts and Maryland—have Republican governors. Meanwhile, many Republican-led states are actively trying to subvert local measures. Nebraska Governor Pete Ricketts has gone so far as to say he will withhold federal coronavirus relief funds from local governments if they try and mandate mask use in their places of work. Rejecting face masks inevitably means embracing more COVID-19 cases and deaths. One U.S. study found that states with a mandate had a more rapid decline in daily growth rates of COVID-19 and estimated that mask use prevented up to 450,000 cases of COVID-19 by May 22, 2020. And while researchers at the University of Washington now predict that the U.S. could reach 180,000 COVID-19 deaths by October, they say we could prevent 33,000 of these deaths—more than half of the new deaths the model projects—if at least 95% of people wear a mask. That’s right. We can avert the deaths of 33,000 of our parents, grandparents, siblings, co-workers, teachers, bus drivers, mail carriers, nurses and store and factory workers by just sticking a one-dollar piece of cloth over our noses and mouths. So what’s stopping us? One problem is the “me first” culture in the U.S., in which anti-maskers claim that their right to go around unmasked in public matters more than saving lives. '},\n",

Despite the current limited scientific data detailing their effectiveness, we support the wearing of face coverings by the public when mandated and when in close contact with people whose infection  status they don't know. However, we also encourage everyone to continue to limit their time spent  indoors near potentially infectious people and to not count on or expect a cloth mask or face  covering to protect them or the people around them. The pandemic is not over and will not likely be  over for some time. As states and local jurisdictions reopen, we encourage people to continue to  assess and limit their risks. Cloth masks and face coverings likely do not offer the same degree of  protection as physical distancing, isolation, or limiting personal contact time.  Will face coverings 'flatten the curve' and stop the pandemic?  We have reviewed the many modeling studies that purport to demonstrate that cloth masks or face  coverings have the potential for flattening the curve or significantly decrease the number of cases. These studies fail to recognize several important facts:  • The filter performance of a cloth material does not directly translate or represent its performance on an individual, because it neglects the understanding of fit.  • Cloth masks or coverings come in a variety of shapes, sizes, and materials and are not made  • Transmission is not simply a function of short random interactions between individuals, but  rather a function of particle concentration in the air and the time exposed to that concentration.  • A cloth mask or face covering does very little to prevent the emission or inhalation of small  particles.

COMMENTARY: Masks-for-all for COVID-19 not based on sound data I CIDRAP  small infectious particles is not only biologically plausible, but the epidemiology supports it as an important mode of transmission for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.  In summary, though we support mask wearing by the general public, we continue to conclude that  cloth masks and face coverings are likely to have limited impact on lowering COVID-19  transmission, because they have minimal ability to prevent the emission of small particles, offer  limited personal protection with respect to small particle inhalation, and should not be  recommended as a replacement for physical distancing or reducing time in enclosed spaces with  many potentially infectious people. We are very concerned about messaging that suggests cloth  masks or face coverings can replace physical distancing. We also worry that the public doesn't  understand the limitations of cloth masks and face coverings when we observe how many people  wear their mask under their nose or even under their mouth, remove their masks when talking to  someone nearby, or fail to practice physical distancing when wearing a mask.

       "   'scraped_text': \"This feels like a lopsided fight. In one corner, we have scientists, epidemiologists, infectious-disease physicians, clinicians, engineers—many different experts in the medical community, that is—arguing that the spread of COVID-19 by aerosols (that is, tiny droplets that can remain airborne long enough to travel significantly farther than the six-foot separation we’ve been told to observe) is both real and dangerous. In the other, it’s the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO), which until veryrecently have allowed only that aerosol spread is possible, not necessarily likely. And while watching experts going against governmental agencies isn’t always riveting stuff, this particular battle is terribly important. It has significant implications for how we as a country handle this epidemic, and what decisions we make going forward—and those decisions need to be made sooner, not later. On some level, this is a discussion of droplets versus aerosols. You’ve probably heard plenty this year about droplets: they’re larger in size and may be exhaled by someone talking, shouting, singing, coughing or sneezing. These droplets don’t travel far and fall quickly to the ground, one reason why a “social distance” of roughly six feet is seen as a safe one. If you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today. Aerosols, on the other hand, are tiny by comparison, nearly 10,000 times smaller than a human hair. They’re spread at far greater distances—20 to 30 feet—and can linger in the air for minutes to hours, infecting others. What constitutes a safe distance from aerosols is much harder to define, especially in crowded indoor spaces with poor ventilation. \\nChoosing a safe mask becomes difficult as well: an N95 respirator, for example, would be preferable to an ill-fitting cloth mask when it comes to filtering out these minuscule viral aerosols. For these and other reasons, some in the medical community suspect, our health agencies have been reluctant to accept the data on the airborne transmission of COVID-19—because if they do, they’re acknowledging a problem far more challenging even than what we’ve been dealt with so far. This reluctance has prompted an epic response. In a nearly unprecedented move, 239 scientists from 32 countries wrote an open letter to the WHO in July, urging the agency to recognize that airborne transmission of coronavirus by smaller aerosol particles is possible. The organization’s response was to subsequently update its position, stating that aerosol transmission “cannot be ruled out.” A glowing endorsement this was not—although, points out a spokesperson for the organization, “We have substantial guidance on the topic and speak repeatedly in press conferences and other venues about the importance of keeping indoor spaces well ventilated, precisely because of the potential of aerosol transmission in these settings. WHO has advice in the form of Q&As for the general public, and for people who manage public spaces and buildings and health facilities.” The CDC, meanwhile, posted on its Web site over the weekend that aerosolization may be “the main way the virus spreads,” then backtracked and removed the content from its site, claiming the language had been a draft of some proposed changes which were “posted in error.” This is a major point, not a minor one. Aerosol carry of the virus means that any indoor area where people gather in numbers—think restaurants, bars, churches, schools, rallies—is potentially a spreader of the disease, and depending upon the numbers, a superspreader. These are likely places with poor ventilation, where people not only are close together but may be speaking loudly, shouting, singing, cheering or booing, etc. \\nThe idea of aerosol spread is neither new nor controversial. Several diseases, including measles, chickenpox and tuberculosis, have been shown to be transmitted by aerosols. Patients sick with the flu have the virus in their exhaled breath, and that virus has been shown to be present in the air. This is true for some other viruses, including those found in infants. Scientists in Wuhan, China, have identified coronavirus RNA particles in the air in hospital areas, although they haven’t yet proven that the particles are infectious. Lab workers at the University of Nebraska have published their finding that they, too, have identified coronavirus RNA in the air. “We have pretty strong circumstantial evidence, in a number of these superspreading indoor incidents, that there must have been a significant component of aerosol or airborne transmission,” says William Bahnfleth, chair of the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) Epidemic Task Force. Bahnfleth noted several examples, including a restaurant in Guangzhou, China, where multiple people without direct contact with one another became infected from a single individual, and a choir practice in Washington state where presumed droplet and aerosol spread from singingsickened 53 people, two of whom died. In an e-mail interview, researcher Bjorn Birnir shared his work, published in a preprint (a non–peer reviewed paper), that demonstrated how an infected person continues to exhale a cloud of droplets and aerosols. These “build up over time to dangerous concentrations for everyone in the room,” Birnir says. While we don’t know exactly how much virus is needed to infect people or at what concentrations, these examples show that at some point the threshold is met and inhaled aerosols are the likely culprits. “Aerosol transmission plays a significant role in indoor environments and cannot be neglected,” says environmental science expert Maosheng Yao, a professor of engineering at Peking University. \"},\n",

The reusability of a mask that uses PTFE as the membrane in the filter layer is tested by gently washing the mask 30 times and then drying the mask in air before the PFE is measured. The PFE is only reduced by 10–20% after 30 washes, thus indicating the potential reusability of the mask. The findings in this study will contribute to reducing the pressure of mask shortages and are an environmentally friendly solution to the massive use of disposable masks. Keywords: COVID-19; Mask testing system; Reusable mask; Particle filtration efficiency. The new coronavirus (COVID-19) has become a global public health concern because it is highly contagious with severe or even fatal health consequences. With the rapid spread of COVID-19, self-protection has become crucial to avoid contracting this disease. \\nAs a highly infectious disease, the two main routes of transmission include direct transmission (e.g., spraying droplets emitted from aerosolized particles through sneezing, coughing or talking), and indirect transmission (contact with surfaces that contain the virus or objects that have been in contact with an infected individual) (Liu, 2020; Ningthoujam, 2020; Tomar and Gupta, 2020). However, the former has been documented to be a more prevalent form of transmission, so an effective mask must be worn to obstruct the transmission of the virus and block its spread when conducting daily life activities (Bałazy et al., 2006; MacIntyre and Chughtai, 2020). This has led to the unprecedented demand and shortage of masks, along with the problem of ineffective masks. On the one hand, there are a variety of different masks on the market. Although most commercially available masks claim effectiveness against contact with airborne particles, their actual performance has not been tested adequately. For example, Cheng (2020) reported that there was no quality control in face mask production in Pakistan. In Italy, in order to meet the huge demand of face masks, some industries have reset the production chain, shifting from the usual target products to the production of masks. However, the quality of the masks is questionable and needs to be tested (Amendola et al., 2020). In addition, Lam et al. (2020) examined 160 mask brands on the market and found that 48.8% of them were substandard and/or invalid. With COVID-19 as an urgent public health issue now, it has become imperative to test and validate the performance of these masks with reliable testing equipment. On the other hand, COVID-19 has led to the unprecedented demand for masks, which has resulted in a shortage of materials to fabricate them. Moreover, most of the masks currently found on the market are disposable (i.e., surgical, N95 and KF94 masks). \\nThe widespread use of such disposable masks is having a detrimental effect on the environment, as additional resources and human resources are needed to properly dispose of used masks which might otherwise end up in the oceans or landfills. As such, it is timely to develop effective yet reusable masks, not only to address the needs of the current epidemic but also to conserve resources. One of the key parameters of masks is their particle filtration efficiency (PFE) which reflects the ability of masks and/or filters to block the inhalation of different types of particles. Basically, PFE testing follows the methods stipulated in various standards, which include ASTM F2299 (the United States) and YY 0469-2011/GB19083-2010 (Chinese), and the standard provided by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). In ASTM F2299, polystyrene latex (PSL) particles of a specific size are used to evaluate the PFE of a material. Although the applicable particle size range is from 0.1 µm to 5.0 µm, PSL particles of 0.1 µm are generally used for testing as it is the most penetrating particle size. In YY 0469-2011, sodium chloride (NaCl) particles that range from 0.01 µm to 1.0 µm are used as the index in PFE testing of masks, while the NIOSH standard is used to test masks to filter NaCl particles that are 0.3 µm in size. Although these standard methods provide basic instructions and parameters for PFE testing, they do not offer specific settings for testing systems and details of the equipment involved. Moreover, some of the standard methods have limitations. For instance, a device that is recommended for measuring particle concentration (an optical particle counter (OPC)) is low in accuracy and size-resolution (Rengasamy et al., 2011). Moreover, the standards do not strictly stipulate the size of the particles to be tested, thus resulting in differences and uncertainties in the results with the different testing agents and systems.

       "   'scraped_text': \"A log transformed analysis is conducted to evaluate the growth rate of COVID-19 infections. ANOVA analysis is used to analyze the group effect. The p value is less than 2e-16 for the log 2 transformed case comparison, suggesting that the two groups are statistically significantly different. The Asian mask-wearing group clearly has lower growth rates of COVID-19 cases compared to the non-mask-wearing group. Thailand has the highest growth rate among the mask-wearing groups. However, the differences in the growth rate of confirmed cases between these two groups cannot be fully attributed to mask-wearing, but arise from many factors, such as clinical tests performed, complicated social, economic, and cultural differences, and varied public health polices enforcement. The preliminary comparison only provides the rationale to further evaluate if wearing masks is effective for controlling the infectious disease outbreak. Our study has six major assumptions with preliminary evidence. First, the SARS-CoV-2 transmission pathway includes airborne [1, 8, 22–24] with an R0 value exceeding that of influenza and SARS [16, 32, 33]. Second, a proportion of infected cases could be asymptomatic [36, 38, 46, 47]. Third, asymptomatic individuals could transfer the virus in the community [48, 49, 82]. Fourth, the public awareness of mask usage may increase as the pandemic spreads [64]. Fifth, the market could respond to consumer demand with a production increase and without supply chain problems [67]. Sixth, homemade cloth masks are not as effective as commercial medical masks [57, 60]. Thus, we project the best scenario as the pandemic spreads and by the end of the outbreak, the general population will be willing to wear a mask. Although wearing a mask is a low-cost and non-disruptive measure, wearing a mask has not been culturally widespread in many parts of the world [83]. Furthermore, for non-certified medical masks, individual errors could lead to ineffective mask fitting, which could reduce the benefit of wearing a mask [84]. \\nThere are limitations to those six assumptions. First, a recent study suggested that the virus was detected on the outer layer of COVID-19 patients' masks [85], which could invalidate the utility of a patient wearing a mask. However, although the virus was detected, the mask could still provide prevention by reducing the virus load to an adjacent healthy individual. Further studies on asymptomatic individuals wearing masks could be more convincing to validate the effectiveness of wearing a mask to prevent pre-symptomatic transmission. Second, we assume random mixing and model the general population, but have not taken account children's role. Children are less likely to wear masks consistently to realize mask effectiveness. At the same time, the role of children in COVID-19 transmission is unclear [86]. Third, we assume the willing individual who has a mask can use the mask in the right manner and follow social distancing and other personal hygiene practices. There are discrepancies between willingness, perceived compliance, and real compliance [87]. Fourth, research shows that masks can be a source of contamination if not disposed of or replaced in timely manner The COVID-19 pandemic has created a global crisis. Prevention such as vaccines is one of the most effective measures to mitigate such a catastrophic public health crisis. Prior to an available vaccine, NPIs such as wearing a mask can potentially reduce the virus transmission rate. Recent modeling studies suggest that timely and comprehensive NPIs are needed to prevent a secondary wave of COVID-19 [89]. However, timely implementations of NPI such as wearing a mask call for public awareness, a readily available market stockpile, and government advocacy and policies. For respiratory diseases caused by a rival agent through aerosol and droplet transmission routes, wearing masks could be a reasonable NPI to reduce the virus transmission efficiency and secondary transmission [5, 89]. \\nHowever, masks do not replace social distancing and other personal hygiene practices, such as hand washing. The effectiveness of any NPIs depends on compliance rates, contact rate reduction, the role of children, and asymptomatic cases in transmission. Our model analyzes the impact of wearing a mask that can efficiently filter viral aerosols during the COVID-19 pandemic in the general population. Our study suggests that wearing a quality mask in combination with other NPIs can support hospital resource management during a pandemic. In a free market, the risks of not having enough masks for the general population may negatively impact timely responses to the outbreak. Appropriate public health policies and government subsidies could be necessary to manage similar crises in the future. Future studies on how to improve adherence and compliance rates will better position society for potential future respiratory disease outbreaks when the viral agent has a similar clinical attack rate. - 1.

Furthermore, the widespread use of disposable masks has led to shortage of filter materials and problems with their haphazard disposal. In this study, a testing system that is based on standardized methods has been established and enhanced to reliably measure the particle filtration efficiency (PFE) of masks. Quality control experiments that examine the filtration efficiency of polystyrene latex (PSL) particles that are 0.1 µm in size and sodium chloride (NaCl) particles that range from 0.01–1.0 µm are conducted to determine the reliability of the testing system. Moreover, various textile materials are tested to fabricate 3-layer face masks, and the PFE of these masks is tested by using the proposed testing system to find the most suitable materials and the likelihood of their reusability. Among the tested materials, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) used as the membrane in the filter layer has the highest PFE of 88.33% ± 1.80%, which is mainly due to its dense and multilayer structure.

Despite the current limited scientific data detailing their effectiveness, we support the wearing of face coverings by the public when mandated and when in close contact with people whose infection  status they don't know. However, we also encourage everyone to continue to limit their time spent  indoors near potentially infectious people and to not count on or expect a cloth mask or face  covering to protect them or the people around them. The pandemic is not over and will not likely be  over for some time. As states and local jurisdictions reopen, we encourage people to continue to  assess and limit their risks. Cloth masks and face coverings likely do not offer the same degree of  protection as physical distancing, isolation, or limiting personal contact time.  Will face coverings 'flatten the curve' and stop the pandemic?  We have reviewed the many modeling studies that purport to demonstrate that cloth masks or face  coverings have the potential for flattening the curve or significantly decrease the number of cases. These studies fail to recognize several important facts:  • The filter performance of a cloth material does not directly translate or represent its performance on an individual, because it neglects the understanding of fit.  • Cloth masks or coverings come in a variety of shapes, sizes, and materials and are not made  • Transmission is not simply a function of short random interactions between individuals, but  rather a function of particle concentration in the air and the time exposed to that concentration.  • A cloth mask or face covering does very little to prevent the emission or inhalation of small  particles.

In summary, though we support mask wearing by the general public, we continue to conclude that  cloth masks and face coverings are likely to have limited impact on lowering COVID-19  transmission, because they have minimal ability to prevent the emission of small particles, offer  limited personal protection with respect to small particle inhalation, and should not be  recommended as a replacement for physical distancing or reducing time in enclosed spaces with  many potentially infectious people. We are very concerned about messaging that suggests cloth  masks or face coverings can replace physical distancing. We also worry that the public doesn't  understand the limitations of cloth masks and face coverings when we observe how many people  wear their mask under their nose or even under their mouth, remove their masks when talking to  someone nearby, or fail to practice physical distancing when wearing a mask.

       "   'scraped_text': \"This feels like a lopsided fight. In one corner, we have scientists, epidemiologists, infectious-disease physicians, clinicians, engineers—many different experts in the medical community, that is—arguing that the spread of COVID-19 by aerosols (that is, tiny droplets that can remain airborne long enough to travel significantly farther than the six-foot separation we’ve been told to observe) is both real and dangerous. In the other, it’s the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO), which until veryrecently have allowed only that aerosol spread is possible, not necessarily likely. And while watching experts going against governmental agencies isn’t always riveting stuff, this particular battle is terribly important. It has significant implications for how we as a country handle this epidemic, and what decisions we make going forward—and those decisions need to be made sooner, not later. On some level, this is a discussion of droplets versus aerosols. You’ve probably heard plenty this year about droplets: they’re larger in size and may be exhaled by someone talking, shouting, singing, coughing or sneezing. These droplets don’t travel far and fall quickly to the ground, one reason why a “social distance” of roughly six feet is seen as a safe one. If you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today. Aerosols, on the other hand, are tiny by comparison, nearly 10,000 times smaller than a human hair. They’re spread at far greater distances—20 to 30 feet—and can linger in the air for minutes to hours, infecting others. What constitutes a safe distance from aerosols is much harder to define, especially in crowded indoor spaces with poor ventilation. \\nChoosing a safe mask becomes difficult as well: an N95 respirator, for example, would be preferable to an ill-fitting cloth mask when it comes to filtering out these minuscule viral aerosols. For these and other reasons, some in the medical community suspect, our health agencies have been reluctant to accept the data on the airborne transmission of COVID-19—because if they do, they’re acknowledging a problem far more challenging even than what we’ve been dealt with so far. This reluctance has prompted an epic response. In a nearly unprecedented move, 239 scientists from 32 countries wrote an open letter to the WHO in July, urging the agency to recognize that airborne transmission of coronavirus by smaller aerosol particles is possible. The organization’s response was to subsequently update its position, stating that aerosol transmission “cannot be ruled out.” A glowing endorsement this was not—although, points out a spokesperson for the organization, “We have substantial guidance on the topic and speak repeatedly in press conferences and other venues about the importance of keeping indoor spaces well ventilated, precisely because of the potential of aerosol transmission in these settings. WHO has advice in the form of Q&As for the general public, and for people who manage public spaces and buildings and health facilities.” The CDC, meanwhile, posted on its Web site over the weekend that aerosolization may be “the main way the virus spreads,” then backtracked and removed the content from its site, claiming the language had been a draft of some proposed changes which were “posted in error.” This is a major point, not a minor one. Aerosol carry of the virus means that any indoor area where people gather in numbers—think restaurants, bars, churches, schools, rallies—is potentially a spreader of the disease, and depending upon the numbers, a superspreader. These are likely places with poor ventilation, where people not only are close together but may be speaking loudly, shouting, singing, cheering or booing, etc. \\nThe idea of aerosol spread is neither new nor controversial. Several diseases, including measles, chickenpox and tuberculosis, have been shown to be transmitted by aerosols. Patients sick with the flu have the virus in their exhaled breath, and that virus has been shown to be present in the air. This is true for some other viruses, including those found in infants. Scientists in Wuhan, China, have identified coronavirus RNA particles in the air in hospital areas, although they haven’t yet proven that the particles are infectious. Lab workers at the University of Nebraska have published their finding that they, too, have identified coronavirus RNA in the air. “We have pretty strong circumstantial evidence, in a number of these superspreading indoor incidents, that there must have been a significant component of aerosol or airborne transmission,” says William Bahnfleth, chair of the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) Epidemic Task Force. Bahnfleth noted several examples, including a restaurant in Guangzhou, China, where multiple people without direct contact with one another became infected from a single individual, and a choir practice in Washington state where presumed droplet and aerosol spread from singingsickened 53 people, two of whom died. In an e-mail interview, researcher Bjorn Birnir shared his work, published in a preprint (a non–peer reviewed paper), that demonstrated how an infected person continues to exhale a cloud of droplets and aerosols. These “build up over time to dangerous concentrations for everyone in the room,” Birnir says. While we don’t know exactly how much virus is needed to infect people or at what concentrations, these examples show that at some point the threshold is met and inhaled aerosols are the likely culprits. “Aerosol transmission plays a significant role in indoor environments and cannot be neglected,” says environmental science expert Maosheng Yao, a professor of engineering at Peking University. \"}],\n",

For instance, Sinema’s team pointed to a January 2017 concurrent resolution setting a budget blueprint for fiscal year 2017; Sinema voted against it, McSally for it. Its main purpose was to facilitate repeal of the Affordable Care Act. But the resolution did create the possibility of making changes to Medicare that could be interpreted as cuts, said Paul N. Van de Water, a senior fellow at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, where he specializes in Medicare, Social Security, and health coverage issues. Still, budget resolutions even if they pass do not become law; they lay out a plan. Budget resolutions also don’t affect Social Security — at least not directly — because there are rules against it, Van de Water said. Sinema’s team pointed to McSally and Sinema’s stance on transitioning Medicare to the Republican-favored \"premium support\" program, or \"vouchers\" as Democrats critically call it. Under the premium support/voucher system, beneficiaries would receive a payment to buy private insurance, or a traditional fee-for-service Medicare plan. A goal of switching over to the premium support/voucher approach is to reduce the growth in Medicare spending. Arguments against the switch include concerns that it would shift more costs to beneficiaries over time. Van de Water told PolitiFact that a premium support/voucher system would in most cases make traditional Medicare more expensive relative to the Medicare Advantage Plans (Medicare plans offered by a private company that contracts with Medicare). It’s fair to say that voting for a premium support/voucher system would be, at least in principle, a vote for cuts in Medicare, Van de Water said. \\nMcSally has cast votes for motions and resolutions that would support a premium support/voucher program or restructure Social Security, and raise the retirement age, Sinema’s team said, pointing to roll-calls and media reports. Sinema’s campaign also said that in 2013, Sinema and other lawmakers wrote to former President Barack Obama urging him to reject any budget proposal that would raise the retirement age or cut Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security benefits, specifically mentioning \"Chained CPI\" (an inflation adjustment measure). As PolitiFact Florida reported, a proposal to use chained CPI for inflation would not have lowered seniors’ Social Security checks, but their checks would have grown at a slower rate. The impact of the proposal would have depended upon the particulars in any separate legislation that became law, PolitiFact Florida found in a similar gubernatorial race fact-check. Sinema’s campaign also said McSally voted in favor of the tax cuts Trump signed into law late 2017 (Sinema voted against), saying they will lower Medicare and Social Security’s projected revenue. We’ve rated Half True claims linking the tax cuts to Medicare and Social Security’s future payments. The tax cuts are projected to increase the deficit, and some Republicans have called for entitlement reform to address it. Experts say that potential changes or \"cuts\" to Medicare and Social Security would not be just because of the tax cuts. The programs already are on an unsustainable trajectory. While it\\'s common for a candidate to attack another for trying to do anything to bring the systems into balance, the bottom line is that either Congress will have to slow the growth of the program, raise taxes, or both. \\nAsked about Sinema’s position to ensure the program\\'s financial viability in the future, her campaign didn’t give specifics, saying only that Sinema \"believes we need to protect Medicare and Social Security benefits, weed out waste, fraud and abuse, and work together to ensure that the program is able to fulfill its long-term commitments to current and future retirees.\" There are instances where McSally’s and Sinema’s votes aligned. Sinema in April 2015 voted for a motion instructing House conferees to agree with the Senate in preventing Medicare from becoming a \"voucher program,\" Sinema’s campaign said. Both lawmakers in October 2017 also voted against a budget proposal that called for \"slashing trillions from domestic and foreign-affairs programs and entitlements including Medicare and Medicaid, repealing the Affordable Care Act and changing Social Security,\" Tucson.com reported. McSally’s campaign did not push back on Sinema’s claims about McSally’s record. Instead, it spotlighted Sinema’s own record. One example McSally’s campaign provided: Sinema in April 2018 voted in favor of a \"balanced-budget amendment,\" which House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi described as \"an act of breathtaking hypocrisy and an open assault on Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security,\" and one \"purpose-built to force devastating cuts in Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security.\" McSally also voted in favor of the proposal. It did not pass. While Sinema’s team said her website’s claim was only directed toward McSally, other candidates in the race, including Republicans Ward and Arpaio, told PolitiFact they opposed cuts to Medicare, Social Security, and raising the retirement age. Sinema’s Democratic opponent in the primary, civil rights attorney Deedra Abboud, also said she was against cuts to seniors’ benefits or raising the retirement age. Sinema on her campaign website said she is \"the only candidate for Senate who refuses to cut Medicare and Social Security or raise the retirement age.\" '), Evidence(question='What is the premium support/voucher program for Medicare?', answer='Under the premium support/voucher system, beneficiaries would receive a payment to buy private insurance, or a traditional fee-for-service Medicare plan.', url='https://www.factcheck.org/2018/11/democratic-closing-ads-health-care-and-taxes/', scraped_text='In the past week, many Democratic ads across the country have focused on health care and taxes, campaign-long themes for the party’s candidates. Some of the ads have used familiar, and misleading, talking points. On health care: An ad from the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee claims that Republican Rep. Martha McSally “voted to essentially end Medicare,” a reference to a GOP budget resolution calling for significant changes — not an end — to Medicare. On taxes: Several ads in House races claim the Republican tax law, passed in late 2017, gives 83 percent of the benefits to the top 1 percent. That’s only the case for 2027, because most of the individual income tax changes in the law expire by then. Republicans say a future Congress will extend the tax cuts. In 2025, a quarter of the tax cuts go to the top 1 percent. This ad from the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee dredges up an old claim we haven’t heard much in recent years — saying Republican Rep. Martha McSally of Arizona “voted to essentially end Medicare.” That’s a reference to a budget plan, first proposed by Rep. Paul Ryan, that calls for changing Medicare — not ending it — to a system in which seniors would use premium-support payments to select their own plan from a Medicare exchange. Longtime readers of FactCheck.org surely remember this claim from 2011, 2012, the 2014 midterms and more. Democratic Rep. Kyrsten Sinema also tweeted the claim in mid-October. Both the tweet and the ad include the words “essentially end Medicare” in quotes and refer to a Wall Street Journal article. But that’s a truncated quote from the 2011 Journal article, which said Ryan’s plan “would essentially end Medicare, which now pays most of the health-care bills for 48 million elderly and disabled Americans, as a program that directly pays those bills.” So it wouldn’t terminate the Medicare program, as the ad says. Instead, it would change how the program operates. \\nRyan’s plan got the most attention in 2011, when he first introduced it, and in 2012, when Ryan was Mitt Romney’s presidential running mate. It has continued to be a part of GOP budget proposals, even though it has not moved forward in legislation to actually implement it. McSally voted for the GOP House budget resolution in 2017, which again included Ryan’s premium-support proposal. (The vote got the most attention for being the first step toward Republicans passing a tax cut plan.) The DSCC also points to a 2012 interview with McSally, when she was running in a special election for the House, in which she said she would have voted for the Ryan budget. She added that there were things she disagreed with in the bill “as far as Medicare” — without elaborating on that point — “but of the options, I think that one was the best one put forward.” A budget resolution doesn’t actually implement policy — it’s not binding law, but rather a blueprint of the budget and priorities. The Ryan plan, as we’ve written before, would be a fundamental change for Medicare. It would affect those under age 55, who, once eligible for Medicare, would be given a choice of private plans or traditional Medicare and federal subsidies to help pay for them. It would be similar to Medicare Advantage meets the Affordable Care Act’s insurance exchanges. There are both critics and supporters of this type of plan, and whether it would be beneficial or more/less expensive for seniors is a matter of debate. The DSCC emphasizes that it’s a “voucher” program, while Ryan prefers “premium-support” plan. But whatever you call it, it wouldn’t “end” the federal health care program for seniors. Many Democrats have assailed their opponents’ positions on preexisting conditions, pointing to votes to repeal the Affordable Care Act, votes for Republican health care plans and support for a lawsuit in Texas seeking to invalidate the Affordable Care Act. \\nThe DSCC ad, too, adds that McSally voted to “gut protections for preexisting conditions,” citing her votes for the House-passed American Health Care Act and a 2015 vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act. The ACA instituted broad protections for those with preexisting conditions — prohibiting insurers from denying policies, excluding coverage or pricing plans based on health status. That primarily affected the individual market, where such practices were common, and where people without employer-sponsored plans or public coverage, such as Medicare and Medicaid, buy their own coverage. It’s true that repealing the ACA would repeal those protections, and the GOP repeal-and-replace plans considered by Congress in 2017 would have weakened those protections. The House’s American Health Care Act would allow insurers to price plans based on health status in some cases where there was a gap in coverage, and allow states to change or eliminate ACA requirements for insurers to cover certain benefits (see “The Preexisting Conditions Debate” for the details on the bill). Other Democratic ads – such as this one from Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill – have referred to the Texas lawsuit, brought by Republican officials in 20 states and supported by the Trump administration. The Department of Justice said if the lawsuit were successful, the entire ACA wouldn’t need to be scrapped; however, it said the provisions prohibiting insurance companies from denying coverage or charging more based on health status would have to be eliminated. If the ACA’s protections were to be eliminated or repealed, there would still be some previously existing protections for those with employer plans, who couldn’t be denied coverage or charged more based on health status under the 1996 Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act.

Making improvements to Medicare is a laudable goal, but doing it in a way that will cost the average senior thousands of dollars at a time in their life when they can least afford it is not. Neither is shortchanging the hardworking Americans who have paid into the system throughout their working lives. Perhaps the most visible plan to cut Medicare is the one endorsed by House Speaker Paul Ryan, which would eliminate the guaranteed level of coverage that Medicare currently provides — e.g., covering hospital care and 80 percent of the total cost of doctor visits — and replace it with “vouchers” with which seniors would be directed to buy their own health insurance from the private sector. Other plans being circulated in Congress contemplate similar approaches, the end result of which can best be described as shifting more risk to seniors – a risk that means either paying more for their healthcare or getting less of it. Under these congressional plans, what happens to seniors if, for example, the values of the vouchers they receive fail to provide them with enough to buy what Medicare now covers? And what happens if the ongoing costs of their coverage exceed the amount of the vouchers they will now receive? The two choices appear to be a) either pay more out of their own pocket for the same coverage, or b) skip the medical care in question. While Speaker Ryan has dubbed his voucher-based approach “premium support,” no one should be misled by the benign-sounding term. This is a clear downgrade of the Medicare benefits people have earned throughout their working lives, and the use of buzzwords like “modernization” and “choice” cannot hide the fact that seniors will be asked to bear more risk at greater personal cost. \\nTo justify what they position as the “we-have-no-choice” necessity of their plans, congressional leaders have characterized Medicare, in operation for more than 50 years, as “going broke.” That’s simply not true. In fact, both the Medicare Trustees Report and The Congressional Budget Office report that Medicare’s fiscal strength has improved — not declined — in recent years and that the Medicare trust fund is fully funded through 2029 and 79-percent funded through 2040, a highly manageable shortfall that can be closed in coming years without experimenting with, or reducing, seniors’ healthcare coverage. In an effort to make their plans to diminish Medicare seem more palatable, and be able to say that “no current Medicare beneficiaries will be affected,” the timeline for the proposed cuts is said to be pushed out a few years. But that fails to explain that when these new changes do kick in, current beneficiaries will be affected. By moving younger, healthier seniors into private plans via the use of vouchers, those now in the traditional Medicare program will see their own premiums rise dramatically. As a result, the Medicare benefits they have earned throughout their working lives and count upon may soon become unaffordable. Fortunately for seniors and their families, those same congressional plans to alter Medicare’s fundamental promises will likely bump up against President Donald Trump, who campaigned on promises not to “touch” the benefits seniors have earned. The new President first expressed his views on the subject and distinguished himself from other Republican primary contenders and went on to make his commitment not to cut Medicare an ongoing element of his general-election campaign: “I am going to protect and save your Social Security and your Medicare. Not only do seniors nationwide strongly oppose such changes, but Medicare cuts and congressional plans to reduce Medicare’s long-standing promise to people run afoul of the new President’s often-stated views on the subject.

For instance, Sinema’s team pointed to a January 2017 concurrent resolution setting a budget blueprint for fiscal year 2017; Sinema voted against it, McSally for it. Its main purpose was to facilitate repeal of the Affordable Care Act. But the resolution did create the possibility of making changes to Medicare that could be interpreted as cuts, said Paul N. Van de Water, a senior fellow at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, where he specializes in Medicare, Social Security, and health coverage issues. Still, budget resolutions even if they pass do not become law; they lay out a plan. Budget resolutions also don’t affect Social Security — at least not directly — because there are rules against it, Van de Water said. Sinema’s team pointed to McSally and Sinema’s stance on transitioning Medicare to the Republican-favored \"premium support\" program, or \"vouchers\" as Democrats critically call it. Under the premium support/voucher system, beneficiaries would receive a payment to buy private insurance, or a traditional fee-for-service Medicare plan. A goal of switching over to the premium support/voucher approach is to reduce the growth in Medicare spending. Arguments against the switch include concerns that it would shift more costs to beneficiaries over time. Van de Water told PolitiFact that a premium support/voucher system would in most cases make traditional Medicare more expensive relative to the Medicare Advantage Plans (Medicare plans offered by a private company that contracts with Medicare). It’s fair to say that voting for a premium support/voucher system would be, at least in principle, a vote for cuts in Medicare, Van de Water said. \\nMcSally has cast votes for motions and resolutions that would support a premium support/voucher program or restructure Social Security, and raise the retirement age, Sinema’s team said, pointing to roll-calls and media reports.

In fact, both the Medicare Trustees Report and The Congressional Budget Office report that Medicare’s fiscal strength has improved — not declined — in recent years and that the Medicare trust fund is fully funded through 2029 and 79-percent funded through 2040, a highly manageable shortfall that can be closed in coming years without experimenting with, or reducing, seniors’ healthcare coverage. In an effort to make their plans to diminish Medicare seem more palatable, and be able to say that “no current Medicare beneficiaries will be affected,” the timeline for the proposed cuts is said to be pushed out a few years. But that fails to explain that when these new changes do kick in, current beneficiaries will be affected. By moving younger, healthier seniors into private plans via the use of vouchers, those now in the traditional Medicare program will see their own premiums rise dramatically. As a result, the Medicare benefits they have earned throughout their working lives and count upon may soon become unaffordable. Fortunately for seniors and their families, those same congressional plans to alter Medicare’s fundamental promises will likely bump up against President Donald Trump, who campaigned on promises not to “touch” the benefits seniors have earned. The new President first expressed his views on the subject and distinguished himself from other Republican primary contenders and went on to make his commitment not to cut Medicare an ongoing element of his general-election campaign: “I am going to protect and save your Social Security and your Medicare. Not only do seniors nationwide strongly oppose such changes, but Medicare cuts and congressional plans to reduce Medicare’s long-standing promise to people run afoul of the new President’s often-stated views on the subject. '}, page_content='Medicare is being targeted by key congressional leaders for a sweeping set of changes that would dramatically increase healthcare costs for seniors and ultimately leave them paying more for their healthcare while getting less. Making improvements to Medicare is a laudable goal, but doing it in a way that will cost the average senior thousands of dollars at a time in their life when they can least afford it is not. Neither is shortchanging the hardworking Americans who have paid into the system throughout their working lives. Perhaps the most visible plan to cut Medicare is the one endorsed by House Speaker Paul Ryan, which would eliminate the guaranteed level of coverage that Medicare currently provides — e.g., covering hospital care and 80 percent of the total cost of doctor visits — and replace it with “vouchers” with which seniors would be directed to buy their own health insurance from the private sector. Other plans being circulated in Congress contemplate similar approaches, the end result of which can best be described as shifting more risk to seniors – a risk that means either paying more for their healthcare or getting less of it. Under these congressional plans, what happens to seniors if, for example, the values of the vouchers they receive fail to provide them with enough to buy what Medicare now covers? And what happens if the ongoing costs of their coverage exceed the amount of the vouchers they will now receive? The two choices appear to be a) either pay more out of their own pocket for the same coverage, or b) skip the medical care in question. While Speaker Ryan has dubbed his voucher-based approach “premium support,” no one should be misled by the benign-sounding term. This is a clear downgrade of the Medicare benefits people have earned throughout their working lives, and the use of buzzwords like “modernization” and “choice” cannot hide the fact that seniors will be asked to bear more risk at greater personal cost. '), Document(metadata={'url': 'https://www.factcheck.org/2018/11/democratic-closing-ads-health-care-and-taxes/', 'context_before': 'In the past week, many Democratic ads across the country have focused on health care and taxes, campaign-long themes for the party’s candidates. Some of the ads have used familiar, and misleading, talking points. On health care: An ad from the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee claims that Republican Rep. Martha McSally “voted to essentially end Medicare,” a reference to a GOP budget resolution calling for significant changes — not an end — to Medicare. On taxes: Several ads in House races claim the Republican tax law, passed in late 2017, gives 83 percent of the benefits to the top 1 percent. That’s only the case for 2027, because most of the individual income tax changes in the law expire by then. Republicans say a future Congress will extend the tax cuts. In 2025, a quarter of the tax cuts go to the top 1 percent. This ad from the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee dredges up an old claim we haven’t heard much in recent years — saying Republican Rep. Martha McSally of Arizona “voted to essentially end Medicare.” That’s a reference to a budget plan, first proposed by Rep. Paul Ryan, that calls for changing Medicare — not ending it — to a system in which seniors would use premium-support payments to select their own plan from a Medicare exchange. Longtime readers of FactCheck.org surely remember this claim from 2011, 2012, the 2014 midterms and more. Democratic Rep. Kyrsten Sinema also tweeted the claim in mid-October. Both the tweet and the ad include the words “essentially end Medicare” in quotes and refer to a Wall Street Journal article. But that’s a truncated quote from the 2011 Journal article, which said Ryan’s plan “would essentially end Medicare, which now pays most of the health-care bills for 48 million elderly and disabled Americans, as a program that directly pays those bills.” So it wouldn’t terminate the Medicare program, as the ad says. Instead, it would change how the program operates. ', 'context_after': 'The DSCC ad, too, adds that McSally voted to “gut protections for preexisting conditions,” citing her votes for the House-passed American Health Care Act and a 2015 vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act. The ACA instituted broad protections for those with preexisting conditions — prohibiting insurers from denying policies, excluding coverage or pricing plans based on health status. That primarily affected the individual market, where such practices were common, and where people without employer-sponsored plans or public coverage, such as Medicare and Medicaid, buy their own coverage. It’s true that repealing the ACA would repeal those protections, and the GOP repeal-and-replace plans considered by Congress in 2017 would have weakened those protections. The House’s American Health Care Act would allow insurers to price plans based on health status in some cases where there was a gap in coverage, and allow states to change or eliminate ACA requirements for insurers to cover certain benefits (see “The Preexisting Conditions Debate” for the details on the bill). Other Democratic ads – such as this one from Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill – have referred to the Texas lawsuit, brought by Republican officials in 20 states and supported by the Trump administration. The Department of Justice said if the lawsuit were successful, the entire ACA wouldn’t need to be scrapped; however, it said the provisions prohibiting insurance companies from denying coverage or charging more based on health status would have to be eliminated. If the ACA’s protections were to be eliminated or repealed, there would still be some previously existing protections for those with employer plans, who couldn’t be denied coverage or charged more based on health status under the 1996 Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. Before the ACA, those with employer plans could face coverage exclusions, however, if they had a gap in insurance coverage. For more on those details, see our story “Kavanaugh and the Preexisting Conditions Debate.” '}, page_content='Ryan’s plan got the most attention in 2011, when he first introduced it, and in 2012, when Ryan was Mitt Romney’s presidential running mate. It has continued to be a part of GOP budget proposals, even though it has not moved forward in legislation to actually implement it. McSally voted for the GOP House budget resolution in 2017, which again included Ryan’s premium-support proposal. (The vote got the most attention for being the first step toward Republicans passing a tax cut plan.) The DSCC also points to a 2012 interview with McSally, when she was running in a special election for the House, in which she said she would have voted for the Ryan budget. She added that there were things she disagreed with in the bill “as far as Medicare” — without elaborating on that point — “but of the options, I think that one was the best one put forward.” A budget resolution doesn’t actually implement policy — it’s not binding law, but rather a blueprint of the budget and priorities. The Ryan plan, as we’ve written before, would be a fundamental change for Medicare. It would affect those under age 55, who, once eligible for Medicare, would be given a choice of private plans or traditional Medicare and federal subsidies to help pay for them. It would be similar to Medicare Advantage meets the Affordable Care Act’s insurance exchanges. There are both critics and supporters of this type of plan, and whether it would be beneficial or more/less expensive for seniors is a matter of debate. The DSCC emphasizes that it’s a “voucher” program, while Ryan prefers “premium-support” plan. But whatever you call it, it wouldn’t “end” the federal health care program for seniors. Many Democrats have assailed their opponents’ positions on preexisting conditions, pointing to votes to repeal the Affordable Care Act, votes for Republican health care plans and support for a lawsuit in Texas seeking to invalidate the Affordable Care Act.

Today, after a meeting with pharmaceutical industry lobbyists and executives, he abandoned that pledge, referring to an idea he supported as recently as three weeks ago as a form of “price fixing” that would hurt “smaller, younger companies.” Instead of getting tough, Trump’s new plan is that he’s “going to be lowering taxes” and “getting rid of regulations.” New drugs are generally covered by patent monopolies, so drug companies have a lot of pricing power; other companies can’t produce the same drug without paying royalties, so there’s little competition. But most countries use their nationalized health care systems to negotiate a good deal on drug prices. Manufacturing pills is cheap, so it’s usually still profitable for a company to sell medicine at a pretty steep discount. The United States doesn’t have a nationalized health care system, but we do have Medicare for senior citizens, and since the USA is a very large country, that’s still a huge potential bulk purchaser. But a 2003 law written by congressional Republicans and signed by George W. Bush prohibits the federal government from using that negotiating power. As recently as January 11, President-elect Trump was promising to revisit this policy. “Pharma has a lot of lobbies, a lot of lobbyists and a lot of power.

Although Trump told Republican senators that lowering prescription prices is “something you have to do,” many remain reluctant to use federal authority to force drugmakers to charge less. Meanwhile, congressional Democrats calculate that the election will strengthen their hand, and they’ll finally be able to enact a law that authorizes Medicare to negotiate prices directly. Neither side in Congress has had an incentive to deal, and the White House has been unable to work Trump’s will. Last year the House did pass Pelosi’s Medicare negotiations bill, which would have capped out-of-pocket drug costs for older people and expanded program benefits as well. It had no path forward in the Republican Senate, and the White House calls it unworkable. But there was an alternative. A bipartisan Senate bill backed by Trump stopped short of giving Medicare bargaining power, but would have limited annual price increases and capped costs for older people. The bill passed out of a Senate committee but was never brought to the full body. “It’s not clear why the administration hasn’t made a bigger push to line up votes to get a bill through the Senate and a deal with Congress, given strong public support to lower drug costs,” said Tricia Neuman, a Medicare expert with the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation. Americans remain worried about drug costs, with nearly 9 in 10 saying in a recent Gallup-West Health poll that they’re concerned the pharmaceutical industry will take advantage of the coronavirus pandemic to raise prices. Another Gallup-West Health survey found 65% saying the Trump administration had made little or no progress limiting increases in prescription drug costs. WATCH: Should the federal government be able to negotiate the prices of prescription drugs? It’s a particularly important issue for older people, who rely on medications to manage the medical problems associated with advancing age. '}, page_content='WASHINGTON (AP) — Unable to land the big deal with Congress to curb drug costs, President Donald Trump on Friday moved on his own to allow imports of cheaper medicines, along with other limited steps that could have some election-year appeal. At a White House ceremony, Trump signed four executive orders. One was about importation. The others would direct drugmaker rebates straight to patients, provide insulin and EpiPens at steep discounts to low-income people, and use lower international prices to pay for some Medicare drugs. Trump cast his directives as far-reaching, but they mostly update earlier administration ideas that have not yet gone into effect. “I’m unrigging the system that is many decades old,” he declared, promising “massive” savings. Consumers may not notice immediate changes, since the orders must be carried out by the federal bureaucracy and could face court challenges. WATCH: Trump announces $5 billion more for nursing homes Democrats, meanwhile, are eager to draw a contrast between Trump and their own sweeping plans to authorize Medicare to negotiate lower prices with pharmaceutical companies, an idea the president had backed as a candidate. A bill by Speaker Nancy Pelosi already passed the House and aligns with presidential candidate Joe Biden’s approach. Friday’s event was definitely not the bill-signing the White House had once hoped for. Trump came into office complaining that pharmaceutical companies were “getting away with murder” and promising to bring them under control. Nearly four years later, things are much the same despite some recent moderation in price increases. Trump pulled his punches, Pelosi said in a statement. “After promising that he would ‘negotiate like crazy’ for lower prescription drug prices, it is clear that President Trump meant not negotiate at all,” she said, adding that if Trump is serious about lowering prices he should tell Senate Republicans to pass her bill.

The executive orders the president signed will require discounts on insulin and EpiPens that were given to some hospitals to be passed on to patients; and speed up a proposal to import prescription drugs from Canada and other countries for pharmacies, wholesalers and states. The president said the changes should eliminate the \"middlemen\" in drug purchases. \"The middlemen are making a fortune,\" Mr. Trump said, joking he probably sees some of them in Palm Beach, Florida. Mr. Trump said drug company executives will be at the White House on Tuesday and if they don\\'t agree on a solution, an executive order will go into effect to make sure Medicare plans pay the lowest price on the international pharmaceutical market. Americans pay more for prescription drugs each year than people in any other developed country in the world, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. As the coronavirus crisis rages on just a few months before Election Day, the president has honed in on health care, which continues to be an important issue for voters. Among likely voters, a CBS News poll earlier this month found 71% said health care is a \"major\" factor in their vote for president. In a Fox News interview last week, Mr. Trump claimed he would be signing a health care plan in about two weeks, without any substantiating information. Any health care overhaul would have to be passed by a divided Congress. \"We\\'re signing a healthcare plan within two weeks, a full and complete health care plan,\" the president told Chris Wallace on \"Fox News Sunday.\" '), Document(metadata={'url': 'https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/1/31/14453740/trump-medicare-prescription-drugs', 'context_before': '', 'context_after': \"I'll oppose anything that makes it harder for smaller, younger companies to take the risk of bringing their product to a vibrantly competitive market. That includes price-fixing by the biggest dog in the market, Medicare, which is what's happening. But we can increase competition and bidding wars, big time. So what I want, we have to get lower prices, we have to get even better innovation and I want you to move your companies back into the United States. And I want you to manufacture in the United States. We're going to be lowering taxes, we're going to be getting rid of regulations that are unnecessary. Many people watching the chaotic rollout of Trump’s executive orders on immigration, his demands for investigations into phantom vote rigging, his mysterious ties to Russia, his financial conflicts of interest, and his bizarre lies about Inauguration Day crowd size have found themselves wondering why more Republicans don’t stand up to him. This event with PhRMA lobbyists explains why. On most of the big public policy issues of the day, Trump is a very conventional Republican. And on those issues where he hasn’t been conventional, Republican Congress members and business executives feel confident they can turn him around. On some issues, they probably won’t. But on this issue, it seems like they did. I should acknowledge that some reporters who cover this beat don’t agree with my read of these remarks. But Trump picked an HHS Secretary who’s opposed price negotiations, and other ideologically orthodox Republicans to run Medicare and Medicaid and his Office of Management and Budget. When congressional Democrats tried to get an amendment supporting price negotiation into the senate’s budget resolution, Trump didn’t lift a finger to stop them. \"}, page_content='A lot happened in the 2016 campaign, but one of the things Donald Trump did to win the election was shift to the left on a number of key issues — promising to avoid cuts in Social Security and Medicare benefits and adopting a longstanding Democratic pledge to let Medicare negotiate bulk discounts in the price it pays for prescription drugs. Today, after a meeting with pharmaceutical industry lobbyists and executives, he abandoned that pledge, referring to an idea he supported as recently as three weeks ago as a form of “price fixing” that would hurt “smaller, younger companies.” Instead of getting tough, Trump’s new plan is that he’s “going to be lowering taxes” and “getting rid of regulations.” New drugs are generally covered by patent monopolies, so drug companies have a lot of pricing power; other companies can’t produce the same drug without paying royalties, so there’s little competition. But most countries use their nationalized health care systems to negotiate a good deal on drug prices. Manufacturing pills is cheap, so it’s usually still profitable for a company to sell medicine at a pretty steep discount. The United States doesn’t have a nationalized health care system, but we do have Medicare for senior citizens, and since the USA is a very large country, that’s still a huge potential bulk purchaser. But a 2003 law written by congressional Republicans and signed by George W. Bush prohibits the federal government from using that negotiating power. As recently as January 11, President-elect Trump was promising to revisit this policy. “Pharma has a lot of lobbies, a lot of lobbyists and a lot of power. And there’s very little bidding on drugs,” he said at a press conference at Trump Tower in Manhattan. “We’re the largest buyer of drugs in the world, and yet we don’t bid properly.” Today he apparently changed his mind. According to Herb Jackson, the designated pool reporter for the day, Trump’s new policy on prescription drugs is that drug companies should get tax cuts and deregulation (emphasis added): '), Document(metadata={'url': 'https://kffhealthnews.org/news/president-trump-once-again-claims-hes-bringing-down-drug-prices-but-details-of-how-are-skimpy/', 'context_before': '“I don’t know about the 60 or 70%,” she said. “I don’t know what he’s talking about.” Another executive order attempted to address the rebates paid to pharmacy benefit managers within Medicare by directing that these payments instead be used as discounts for beneficiaries within the Part D program, the plans that pay for prescription medications. However, experts pointed out that those discounts usually go toward lowering insurance premiums for seniors. Without applying the discount there, premiums would likely go up. And, in order to keep premiums down, the federal government would need to spend more on subsidies. Analyses from the Congressional Budget Office and other groups predicted that Trump’s rebate proposal would lower drug prices for some seniors, but would also increase federal spending and increase seniors’ premiums. There is also a stipulation in the text of the order, which says the order cannot be implemented if it leads to increased government spending or higher premiums for beneficiaries. Thus, it’s unclear how such a proposal would be implemented. “The executive order on the rebate is internally contradictory, which makes you wonder how they can do this,” said Sachs. Trump is likely to continue saying he has reduced drug prices, not only during the Republican National Convention but for the remainder of the 2020 campaign. Trump likes to present proposals in the works as having been implemented, and we’ve fact-checked him twice before on similar drug-pricing statements. In May 2019, he claimed he brought down drug prices for the first time in 51 years, which we found to be Mostly False. And in early August of that year, we fact-checked a claim about another of his drug-pricing executive orders that inflated his efforts to reduce insulin prices, which we also found to be Mostly False.

While it is true that he signed both of them (though the text of only one is publicly available), experts have expressed skepticism about whether these proposals will be implemented, as well as whether they would lower drug prices significantly for Americans.
