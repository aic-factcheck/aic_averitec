Finance Minister Patrick Chinamasa promised in a budget speech last week to re-engage with international lenders, curb spending and attract investors to revive the economy. '}, page_content='The African Export and Import Bank has pledged up to $1.5 billion in new loans and financial guarantees to Zimbabwe in a major boost for new President Emmerson Mnangagwa\\'s government, the bank\\'s president and chairman said Tuesday. Mnangagwa, who took over last month after veteran autocrat Robert Mugabe quit following a de facto military coup, has vowed to focus on reviving the struggling economy and provide jobs in a nation with an unemployment rate exceeding 80 percent. Afreximbank was the only international lender that stood by Zimbabwe throughout Mugabe\\'s repressive 37-year rule, but its quick announcement of a fresh package of loans and guarantees appeared to be a vote of confidence in the new government. Cairo-based Afreximbank was a major funder of Zimbabwe while the country was cut off from the International Monetary Fund and World Bank for having defaulted on its debt in 1999. Bank president and chairman Okey Oramah told reporters after a meeting with Mnangagwa and senior government officials that Afreximbank would provide $150 million to local banks to help them pay for outstanding critical imports. \"We also discussed a number of other areas that involve additional investment from us for something that will be in the order of $1 billion to $1.5 billion that will include certain kinds of guarantees to encourage investors to come to Zimbabwe. \"We ... want to make sure that we support the stabilization of the economy, that means providing liquidity to make sure that the situation where people are rushing every time to look for cash is dealt with,\" Oramah said. In August, before Mugabe\\'s ouster, Afreximbank provided $600 million to help Zimbabwe pay for imports and $300 million to allow it to print more \"bond notes,\" a quasi-currency that officially trades on par with the U.S. dollar. Zimbabwe has a foreign debt of more than $7 billion and in September said it would not be able to pay $1.8 billion in arrears to the World Bank and African Development Bank until economic fundamentals improved.

The Afreximbank Trade Debt-backed Securities (AFTRADES) will be provided to participating banks as debt securities that could be used as collateral for interbank funds placements in order to promote interbank dealings among Zimbabwean Banks active in trade finance, according to the terms of a memorandum of understanding signed on by Afreximbank, the Zimbabwe Ministry of Finance and Economic Development and the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe. “Our objective is to use this facility to enable trade finance banks in Zimbabwe to access much-needed liquidity from cash-surplus banks in the country, thereby increasing their capacity to deepen their trade finance activities,” said Jean-Louis Ekra, President of Afreximbank, after signing the memorandum of understanding in Cairo on 10 February. Patrick Chinamasa, Minister of Finance and Economic Planning, and Dr. Charity L. Dhliwayo, Acting Governor of the Reserve Bank, had signed it on 31 January on behalf of the Zimbabwean parties. Mr. Ekra said that Afreximbank’s decision to introduce the facility was motivated by its recognition of the serious constraints limiting the access of Zimbabwe’s trade finance banks to funding as a result of the liquidity challenge confronting the financial sector. Under the terms of the memorandum of understanding, AFTRADES would be structured as a collateral swap involving the issuance of securities by Afreximbank to participating banks in exchange for trade–related collateral or securities presented by those banks. \\nThe Government of Zimbabwe, through the Ministry of Finance and Economic Development, will serve as the facility’s guarantor and liquidity support contributor, up to agreed levels, while the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe will grant the regulatory approvals required by the participating banks. In addition, the Reserve Bank will provide the infrastructure required for the implementation and administration of the facility. Only solvent banks which are not facing fundamental problems of viability will be eligible for the facility, according to the memorandum. The African Export Import Bank was established in October 1993 by African governments, African private and institutional investors, and non-African investors to finance and promote intra- and extra-African trade. Its two basic constitutive documents are the Establishment Agreement, which gives it the status of an international organization, and the Charter, which governs its corporate structure and operations. Since 1994, the Bank has approved more than $25 billion in credit facilities in support of African trade, including $3.71 billion in 2012. \\n'), Evidence(question=\"What percentage of Afreximbank's total loans does the amount provided to Zimbabwe represent?\", answer='The loans provided to Zimbabwe ($2.1 billion) represent approximately 4.1% of the total loans provided by Afreximbank ($51 billion).', url='https://www.centralbanking.com/central-banks/reserves/foreign-exchange/4072761/zimbabwe-borrows-985-million-from-pan-african-lenders', scraped_text='\\nZimbabwe borrows $985 million from pan-African lenders The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) has borrowed $985 million from pan-African lending institutions to cover import of basic products, governor John Mangudya told the country’s parliament on March 4.

ANOVA analysis is used to analyze the group effect. The p value is less than 2e-16 for the log 2 transformed case comparison, suggesting that the two groups are statistically significantly different. The Asian mask-wearing group clearly has lower growth rates of COVID-19 cases compared to the non-mask-wearing group. Thailand has the highest growth rate among the mask-wearing groups. However, the differences in the growth rate of confirmed cases between these two groups cannot be fully attributed to mask-wearing, but arise from many factors, such as clinical tests performed, complicated social, economic, and cultural differences, and varied public health polices enforcement. The preliminary comparison only provides the rationale to further evaluate if wearing masks is effective for controlling the infectious disease outbreak. Our study has six major assumptions with preliminary evidence. First, the SARS-CoV-2 transmission pathway includes airborne [1, 8, 22–24] with an R0 value exceeding that of influenza and SARS [16, 32, 33]. Second, a proportion of infected cases could be asymptomatic [36, 38, 46, 47]. Third, asymptomatic individuals could transfer the virus in the community [48, 49, 82]. Fourth, the public awareness of mask usage may increase as the pandemic spreads [64]. Fifth, the market could respond to consumer demand with a production increase and without supply chain problems [67]. Sixth, homemade cloth masks are not as effective as commercial medical masks [57, 60]. Thus, we project the best scenario as the pandemic spreads and by the end of the outbreak, the general population will be willing to wear a mask. Although wearing a mask is a low-cost and non-disruptive measure, wearing a mask has not been culturally widespread in many parts of the world [83]. Furthermore, for non-certified medical masks, individual errors could lead to ineffective mask fitting, which could reduce the benefit of wearing a mask [84]. \\nThere are limitations to those six assumptions. First, a recent study suggested that the virus was detected on the outer layer of COVID-19 patients' masks [85], which could invalidate the utility of a patient wearing a mask. However, although the virus was detected, the mask could still provide prevention by reducing the virus load to an adjacent healthy individual. Further studies on asymptomatic individuals wearing masks could be more convincing to validate the effectiveness of wearing a mask to prevent pre-symptomatic transmission. Second, we assume random mixing and model the general population, but have not taken account children's role. Children are less likely to wear masks consistently to realize mask effectiveness. At the same time, the role of children in COVID-19 transmission is unclear [86]. Third, we assume the willing individual who has a mask can use the mask in the right manner and follow social distancing and other personal hygiene practices. There are discrepancies between willingness, perceived compliance, and real compliance [87]. Fourth, research shows that masks can be a source of contamination if not disposed of or replaced in timely manner The COVID-19 pandemic has created a global crisis. Prevention such as vaccines is one of the most effective measures to mitigate such a catastrophic public health crisis. Prior to an available vaccine, NPIs such as wearing a mask can potentially reduce the virus transmission rate. Recent modeling studies suggest that timely and comprehensive NPIs are needed to prevent a secondary wave of COVID-19 [89]. However, timely implementations of NPI such as wearing a mask call for public awareness, a readily available market stockpile, and government advocacy and policies. For respiratory diseases caused by a rival agent through aerosol and droplet transmission routes, wearing masks could be a reasonable NPI to reduce the virus transmission efficiency and secondary transmission [5, 89]. \\nHowever, masks do not replace social distancing and other personal hygiene practices, such as hand washing. The effectiveness of any NPIs depends on compliance rates, contact rate reduction, the role of children, and asymptomatic cases in transmission. Our model analyzes the impact of wearing a mask that can efficiently filter viral aerosols during the COVID-19 pandemic in the general population. Our study suggests that wearing a quality mask in combination with other NPIs can support hospital resource management during a pandemic. In a free market, the risks of not having enough masks for the general population may negatively impact timely responses to the outbreak. Appropriate public health policies and government subsidies could be necessary to manage similar crises in the future. Future studies on how to improve adherence and compliance rates will better position society for potential future respiratory disease outbreaks when the viral agent has a similar clinical attack rate. - 1.

Furthermore, the widespread use of disposable masks has led to shortage of filter materials and problems with their haphazard disposal. In this study, a testing system that is based on standardized methods has been established and enhanced to reliably measure the particle filtration efficiency (PFE) of masks. Quality control experiments that examine the filtration efficiency of polystyrene latex (PSL) particles that are 0.1 µm in size and sodium chloride (NaCl) particles that range from 0.01–1.0 µm are conducted to determine the reliability of the testing system. Moreover, various textile materials are tested to fabricate 3-layer face masks, and the PFE of these masks is tested by using the proposed testing system to find the most suitable materials and the likelihood of their reusability. Among the tested materials, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) used as the membrane in the filter layer has the highest PFE of 88.33% ± 1.80%, which is mainly due to its dense and multilayer structure. The air permeability of the self-developed masks ranges from 1.41 ± 0.04 to 1.93 ± 0.08, less breathable than the commercial masks. The reusability of a mask that uses PTFE as the membrane in the filter layer is tested by gently washing the mask 30 times and then drying the mask in air before the PFE is measured. The PFE is only reduced by 10–20% after 30 washes, thus indicating the potential reusability of the mask. The findings in this study will contribute to reducing the pressure of mask shortages and are an environmentally friendly solution to the massive use of disposable masks. Keywords: COVID-19; Mask testing system; Reusable mask; Particle filtration efficiency. The new coronavirus (COVID-19) has become a global public health concern because it is highly contagious with severe or even fatal health consequences. With the rapid spread of COVID-19, self-protection has become crucial to avoid contracting this disease. \\nAs a highly infectious disease, the two main routes of transmission include direct transmission (e.g., spraying droplets emitted from aerosolized particles through sneezing, coughing or talking), and indirect transmission (contact with surfaces that contain the virus or objects that have been in contact with an infected individual) (Liu, 2020; Ningthoujam, 2020; Tomar and Gupta, 2020). However, the former has been documented to be a more prevalent form of transmission, so an effective mask must be worn to obstruct the transmission of the virus and block its spread when conducting daily life activities (Bałazy et al., 2006; MacIntyre and Chughtai, 2020). This has led to the unprecedented demand and shortage of masks, along with the problem of ineffective masks. On the one hand, there are a variety of different masks on the market. Although most commercially available masks claim effectiveness against contact with airborne particles, their actual performance has not been tested adequately. For example, Cheng (2020) reported that there was no quality control in face mask production in Pakistan. In Italy, in order to meet the huge demand of face masks, some industries have reset the production chain, shifting from the usual target products to the production of masks. However, the quality of the masks is questionable and needs to be tested (Amendola et al., 2020). In addition, Lam et al. (2020) examined 160 mask brands on the market and found that 48.8% of them were substandard and/or invalid. With COVID-19 as an urgent public health issue now, it has become imperative to test and validate the performance of these masks with reliable testing equipment. On the other hand, COVID-19 has led to the unprecedented demand for masks, which has resulted in a shortage of materials to fabricate them. Moreover, most of the masks currently found on the market are disposable (i.e., surgical, N95 and KF94 masks). \\nThe widespread use of such disposable masks is having a detrimental effect on the environment, as additional resources and human resources are needed to properly dispose of used masks which might otherwise end up in the oceans or landfills. As such, it is timely to develop effective yet reusable masks, not only to address the needs of the current epidemic but also to conserve resources. One of the key parameters of masks is their particle filtration efficiency (PFE) which reflects the ability of masks and/or filters to block the inhalation of different types of particles. Basically, PFE testing follows the methods stipulated in various standards, which include ASTM F2299 (the United States) and YY 0469-2011/GB19083-2010 (Chinese), and the standard provided by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). In ASTM F2299, polystyrene latex (PSL) particles of a specific size are used to evaluate the PFE of a material. Although the applicable particle size range is from 0.1 µm to 5.0 µm, PSL particles of 0.1 µm are generally used for testing as it is the most penetrating particle size. In YY 0469-2011, sodium chloride (NaCl) particles that range from 0.01 µm to 1.0 µm are used as the index in PFE testing of masks, while the NIOSH standard is used to test masks to filter NaCl particles that are 0.3 µm in size. Although these standard methods provide basic instructions and parameters for PFE testing, they do not offer specific settings for testing systems and details of the equipment involved. Moreover, some of the standard methods have limitations. For instance, a device that is recommended for measuring particle concentration (an optical particle counter (OPC)) is low in accuracy and size-resolution (Rengasamy et al., 2011). Moreover, the standards do not strictly stipulate the size of the particles to be tested, thus resulting in differences and uncertainties in the results with the different testing agents and systems.

The impact of this breakthrough seems almost too good to be true. We have found a disease control tool that, when used properly, can dramatically reduce the person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Studies have shown that this tool could reduce transmission by somewhere between 50% and 85%. The tool is cheap and remarkably low-tech. You can even make one at home. It has no significant side effects. And with each passing day, the scientific research showing the tool’s effectiveness gets stronger and stronger. If this tool were a vaccine or medicine, we’d be high-fiving each other and popping the champagne, knowing we’d discovered a crucial means to help prevent the spread of the pandemic. I’m talking, of course, about face masks—cloth, surgical, or even a bandanna. Face masks block the spread of respiratory droplets that can carry the novel coronavirus. But just as with so many other aspects of the response to COVID-19—including mass testing, contact tracing, and the early use of stay-at-home orders—the U.S. is once again squandering this opportunity. In many countries that have so far successfully controlled their COVID-19 epidemics, public health leaders, politicians, and the public have fully embraced the use of face masks with no hint of controversy. A recent study found that countries where masks were widely used soon after their COVID-19 outbreak began were more likely to keep their death rates low and to have a shorter outbreak. Countries like Hong Kong, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam that quickly adopted masking, along with other control measures such as social distancing and track and trace, have reported fewer than 6 deaths per million residents as a result of COVID-19. Yet in the U.S., where the death rate from COVID-19 is now 379 per million people, face masks have been weaponized for partisan purposes. \\nTaking their cues from President Trump, who has refused to appear on camera wearing a face mask and has said that Americans who wear masks are doing so to show their disapproval of him, many of his supporters now see wearing a face mask as an affront to personal liberty. According to the Washington Post, Republican leaders “are less likely to mandate them, and Republican voters are more likely to forgo, and even scorn, them.” Health officials who have promoted mask mandates have quit their jobs after receiving death threats. As a result of this alarming polarization, only 18 states and the District of Columbia are mandating face masks in public across the whole state. Only two—Massachusetts and Maryland—have Republican governors. Meanwhile, many Republican-led states are actively trying to subvert local measures. Nebraska Governor Pete Ricketts has gone so far as to say he will withhold federal coronavirus relief funds from local governments if they try and mandate mask use in their places of work. Rejecting face masks inevitably means embracing more COVID-19 cases and deaths. One U.S. study found that states with a mandate had a more rapid decline in daily growth rates of COVID-19 and estimated that mask use prevented up to 450,000 cases of COVID-19 by May 22, 2020. And while researchers at the University of Washington now predict that the U.S. could reach 180,000 COVID-19 deaths by October, they say we could prevent 33,000 of these deaths—more than half of the new deaths the model projects—if at least 95% of people wear a mask. That’s right. We can avert the deaths of 33,000 of our parents, grandparents, siblings, co-workers, teachers, bus drivers, mail carriers, nurses and store and factory workers by just sticking a one-dollar piece of cloth over our noses and mouths. So what’s stopping us? One problem is the “me first” culture in the U.S., in which anti-maskers claim that their right to go around unmasked in public matters more than saving lives.

Despite the current limited scientific data detailing their effectiveness, we support the wearing of face coverings by the public when mandated and when in close contact with people whose infection  status they don't know. However, we also encourage everyone to continue to limit their time spent  indoors near potentially infectious people and to not count on or expect a cloth mask or face  covering to protect them or the people around them. The pandemic is not over and will not likely be  over for some time. As states and local jurisdictions reopen, we encourage people to continue to  assess and limit their risks. Cloth masks and face coverings likely do not offer the same degree of  protection as physical distancing, isolation, or limiting personal contact time.  Will face coverings 'flatten the curve' and stop the pandemic?  We have reviewed the many modeling studies that purport to demonstrate that cloth masks or face  coverings have the potential for flattening the curve or significantly decrease the number of cases. These studies fail to recognize several important facts:  • The filter performance of a cloth material does not directly translate or represent its performance on an individual, because it neglects the understanding of fit.  • Cloth masks or coverings come in a variety of shapes, sizes, and materials and are not made  • Transmission is not simply a function of short random interactions between individuals, but  rather a function of particle concentration in the air and the time exposed to that concentration.  • A cloth mask or face covering does very little to prevent the emission or inhalation of small  particles. As discussed in an earlier CIDRAP commenta1y_(http, ://www.cidrap.umn.edu/n ws- perspective/2.020/03/commentary-covid-19-transmission-messages-should-l1inge-science)_and more recently by \\nMorawska and Milton (2020) in an open letter to WHO signed by 239 scientists, inhalation of  https://www.cidrap. umn. ed u/news-perspective/2020/04/commenta ry-masks-all-covid-19-not-based-sound-data ? COMMENTARY: Masks-for-all for COVID-19 not based on sound data I CIDRAP  small infectious particles is not only biologically plausible, but the epidemiology supports it as an important mode of transmission for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.  In summary, though we support mask wearing by the general public, we continue to conclude that  cloth masks and face coverings are likely to have limited impact on lowering COVID-19  transmission, because they have minimal ability to prevent the emission of small particles, offer  limited personal protection with respect to small particle inhalation, and should not be  recommended as a replacement for physical distancing or reducing time in enclosed spaces with  many potentially infectious people. We are very concerned about messaging that suggests cloth  masks or face coverings can replace physical distancing. We also worry that the public doesn't  understand the limitations of cloth masks and face coverings when we observe how many people  wear their mask under their nose or even under their mouth, remove their masks when talking to  someone nearby, or fail to practice physical distancing when wearing a mask.

In one corner, we have scientists, epidemiologists, infectious-disease physicians, clinicians, engineers—many different experts in the medical community, that is—arguing that the spread of COVID-19 by aerosols (that is, tiny droplets that can remain airborne long enough to travel significantly farther than the six-foot separation we’ve been told to observe) is both real and dangerous. In the other, it’s the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO), which until veryrecently have allowed only that aerosol spread is possible, not necessarily likely. And while watching experts going against governmental agencies isn’t always riveting stuff, this particular battle is terribly important. It has significant implications for how we as a country handle this epidemic, and what decisions we make going forward—and those decisions need to be made sooner, not later. On some level, this is a discussion of droplets versus aerosols. You’ve probably heard plenty this year about droplets: they’re larger in size and may be exhaled by someone talking, shouting, singing, coughing or sneezing. These droplets don’t travel far and fall quickly to the ground, one reason why a “social distance” of roughly six feet is seen as a safe one.

By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today. Aerosols, on the other hand, are tiny by comparison, nearly 10,000 times smaller than a human hair. They’re spread at far greater distances—20 to 30 feet—and can linger in the air for minutes to hours, infecting others. What constitutes a safe distance from aerosols is much harder to define, especially in crowded indoor spaces with poor ventilation. \\nChoosing a safe mask becomes difficult as well: an N95 respirator, for example, would be preferable to an ill-fitting cloth mask when it comes to filtering out these minuscule viral aerosols. For these and other reasons, some in the medical community suspect, our health agencies have been reluctant to accept the data on the airborne transmission of COVID-19—because if they do, they’re acknowledging a problem far more challenging even than what we’ve been dealt with so far. This reluctance has prompted an epic response. In a nearly unprecedented move, 239 scientists from 32 countries wrote an open letter to the WHO in July, urging the agency to recognize that airborne transmission of coronavirus by smaller aerosol particles is possible. The organization’s response was to subsequently update its position, stating that aerosol transmission “cannot be ruled out.” A glowing endorsement this was not—although, points out a spokesperson for the organization, “We have substantial guidance on the topic and speak repeatedly in press conferences and other venues about the importance of keeping indoor spaces well ventilated, precisely because of the potential of aerosol transmission in these settings. WHO has advice in the form of Q&As for the general public, and for people who manage public spaces and buildings and health facilities.” The CDC, meanwhile, posted on its Web site over the weekend that aerosolization may be “the main way the virus spreads,” then backtracked and removed the content from its site, claiming the language had been a draft of some proposed changes which were “posted in error.” This is a major point, not a minor one. Aerosol carry of the virus means that any indoor area where people gather in numbers—think restaurants, bars, churches, schools, rallies—is potentially a spreader of the disease, and depending upon the numbers, a superspreader. These are likely places with poor ventilation, where people not only are close together but may be speaking loudly, shouting, singing, cheering or booing, etc. \\nThe idea of aerosol spread is neither new nor controversial. Several diseases, including measles, chickenpox and tuberculosis, have been shown to be transmitted by aerosols. Patients sick with the flu have the virus in their exhaled breath, and that virus has been shown to be present in the air. This is true for some other viruses, including those found in infants. Scientists in Wuhan, China, have identified coronavirus RNA particles in the air in hospital areas, although they haven’t yet proven that the particles are infectious. Lab workers at the University of Nebraska have published their finding that they, too, have identified coronavirus RNA in the air. “We have pretty strong circumstantial evidence, in a number of these superspreading indoor incidents, that there must have been a significant component of aerosol or airborne transmission,” says William Bahnfleth, chair of the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) Epidemic Task Force. Bahnfleth noted several examples, including a restaurant in Guangzhou, China, where multiple people without direct contact with one another became infected from a single individual, and a choir practice in Washington state where presumed droplet and aerosol spread from singingsickened 53 people, two of whom died. In an e-mail interview, researcher Bjorn Birnir shared his work, published in a preprint (a non–peer reviewed paper), that demonstrated how an infected person continues to exhale a cloud of droplets and aerosols. These “build up over time to dangerous concentrations for everyone in the room,” Birnir says. While we don’t know exactly how much virus is needed to infect people or at what concentrations, these examples show that at some point the threshold is met and inhaled aerosols are the likely culprits. “Aerosol transmission plays a significant role in indoor environments and cannot be neglected,” says environmental science expert Maosheng Yao, a professor of engineering at Peking University. \"), Evidence(question='What are the limitations of cloth masks in preventing COVID-19 transmission?', answer='Cloth masks have minimal ability to prevent the emission or inhalation of small particles and should not replace physical distancing.', url='https://aaqr.org/articles/aaqr-20-06-covid-0275', scraped_text='The unprecedented demand for masks has now attracted attention on their filtration efficiency.

Keywords: COVID-19; Mask testing system; Reusable mask; Particle filtration efficiency. The new coronavirus (COVID-19) has become a global public health concern because it is highly contagious with severe or even fatal health consequences. With the rapid spread of COVID-19, self-protection has become crucial to avoid contracting this disease. \\nAs a highly infectious disease, the two main routes of transmission include direct transmission (e.g., spraying droplets emitted from aerosolized particles through sneezing, coughing or talking), and indirect transmission (contact with surfaces that contain the virus or objects that have been in contact with an infected individual) (Liu, 2020; Ningthoujam, 2020; Tomar and Gupta, 2020). However, the former has been documented to be a more prevalent form of transmission, so an effective mask must be worn to obstruct the transmission of the virus and block its spread when conducting daily life activities (Bałazy et al., 2006; MacIntyre and Chughtai, 2020). This has led to the unprecedented demand and shortage of masks, along with the problem of ineffective masks. On the one hand, there are a variety of different masks on the market. Although most commercially available masks claim effectiveness against contact with airborne particles, their actual performance has not been tested adequately. For example, Cheng (2020) reported that there was no quality control in face mask production in Pakistan. In Italy, in order to meet the huge demand of face masks, some industries have reset the production chain, shifting from the usual target products to the production of masks. However, the quality of the masks is questionable and needs to be tested (Amendola et al., 2020). In addition, Lam et al. (2020) examined 160 mask brands on the market and found that 48.8% of them were substandard and/or invalid. With COVID-19 as an urgent public health issue now, it has become imperative to test and validate the performance of these masks with reliable testing equipment. On the other hand, COVID-19 has led to the unprecedented demand for masks, which has resulted in a shortage of materials to fabricate them. Moreover, most of the masks currently found on the market are disposable (i.e., surgical, N95 and KF94 masks). \\nThe widespread use of such disposable masks is having a detrimental effect on the environment, as additional resources and human resources are needed to properly dispose of used masks which might otherwise end up in the oceans or landfills. As such, it is timely to develop effective yet reusable masks, not only to address the needs of the current epidemic but also to conserve resources. One of the key parameters of masks is their particle filtration efficiency (PFE) which reflects the ability of masks and/or filters to block the inhalation of different types of particles. Basically, PFE testing follows the methods stipulated in various standards, which include ASTM F2299 (the United States) and YY 0469-2011/GB19083-2010 (Chinese), and the standard provided by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). In ASTM F2299, polystyrene latex (PSL) particles of a specific size are used to evaluate the PFE of a material. Although the applicable particle size range is from 0.1 µm to 5.0 µm, PSL particles of 0.1 µm are generally used for testing as it is the most penetrating particle size. In YY 0469-2011, sodium chloride (NaCl) particles that range from 0.01 µm to 1.0 µm are used as the index in PFE testing of masks, while the NIOSH standard is used to test masks to filter NaCl particles that are 0.3 µm in size. Although these standard methods provide basic instructions and parameters for PFE testing, they do not offer specific settings for testing systems and details of the equipment involved. Moreover, some of the standard methods have limitations. For instance, a device that is recommended for measuring particle concentration (an optical particle counter (OPC)) is low in accuracy and size-resolution (Rengasamy et al., 2011). Moreover, the standards do not strictly stipulate the size of the particles to be tested, thus resulting in differences and uncertainties in the results with the different testing agents and systems.

ANOVA analysis is used to analyze the group effect. The p value is less than 2e-16 for the log 2 transformed case comparison, suggesting that the two groups are statistically significantly different. The Asian mask-wearing group clearly has lower growth rates of COVID-19 cases compared to the non-mask-wearing group. Thailand has the highest growth rate among the mask-wearing groups. However, the differences in the growth rate of confirmed cases between these two groups cannot be fully attributed to mask-wearing, but arise from many factors, such as clinical tests performed, complicated social, economic, and cultural differences, and varied public health polices enforcement. The preliminary comparison only provides the rationale to further evaluate if wearing masks is effective for controlling the infectious disease outbreak. Our study has six major assumptions with preliminary evidence. First, the SARS-CoV-2 transmission pathway includes airborne [1, 8, 22–24] with an R0 value exceeding that of influenza and SARS [16, 32, 33]. Second, a proportion of infected cases could be asymptomatic [36, 38, 46, 47]. Third, asymptomatic individuals could transfer the virus in the community [48, 49, 82]. Fourth, the public awareness of mask usage may increase as the pandemic spreads [64]. Fifth, the market could respond to consumer demand with a production increase and without supply chain problems [67]. Sixth, homemade cloth masks are not as effective as commercial medical masks [57, 60]. Thus, we project the best scenario as the pandemic spreads and by the end of the outbreak, the general population will be willing to wear a mask. Although wearing a mask is a low-cost and non-disruptive measure, wearing a mask has not been culturally widespread in many parts of the world [83]. Furthermore, for non-certified medical masks, individual errors could lead to ineffective mask fitting, which could reduce the benefit of wearing a mask [84]. \\nThere are limitations to those six assumptions. First, a recent study suggested that the virus was detected on the outer layer of COVID-19 patients' masks [85], which could invalidate the utility of a patient wearing a mask. However, although the virus was detected, the mask could still provide prevention by reducing the virus load to an adjacent healthy individual. Further studies on asymptomatic individuals wearing masks could be more convincing to validate the effectiveness of wearing a mask to prevent pre-symptomatic transmission. Second, we assume random mixing and model the general population, but have not taken account children's role. Children are less likely to wear masks consistently to realize mask effectiveness. At the same time, the role of children in COVID-19 transmission is unclear [86]. Third, we assume the willing individual who has a mask can use the mask in the right manner and follow social distancing and other personal hygiene practices. There are discrepancies between willingness, perceived compliance, and real compliance [87]. Fourth, research shows that masks can be a source of contamination if not disposed of or replaced in timely manner The COVID-19 pandemic has created a global crisis. Prevention such as vaccines is one of the most effective measures to mitigate such a catastrophic public health crisis. Prior to an available vaccine, NPIs such as wearing a mask can potentially reduce the virus transmission rate. Recent modeling studies suggest that timely and comprehensive NPIs are needed to prevent a secondary wave of COVID-19 [89]. However, timely implementations of NPI such as wearing a mask call for public awareness, a readily available market stockpile, and government advocacy and policies. For respiratory diseases caused by a rival agent through aerosol and droplet transmission routes, wearing masks could be a reasonable NPI to reduce the virus transmission efficiency and secondary transmission [5, 89]. \\nHowever, masks do not replace social distancing and other personal hygiene practices, such as hand washing. The effectiveness of any NPIs depends on compliance rates, contact rate reduction, the role of children, and asymptomatic cases in transmission. Our model analyzes the impact of wearing a mask that can efficiently filter viral aerosols during the COVID-19 pandemic in the general population. Our study suggests that wearing a quality mask in combination with other NPIs can support hospital resource management during a pandemic. In a free market, the risks of not having enough masks for the general population may negatively impact timely responses to the outbreak. Appropriate public health policies and government subsidies could be necessary to manage similar crises in the future. Future studies on how to improve adherence and compliance rates will better position society for potential future respiratory disease outbreaks when the viral agent has a similar clinical attack rate. - 1.

Despite the current limited scientific data detailing their effectiveness, we support the wearing of face coverings by the public when mandated and when in close contact with people whose infection  status they don't know. However, we also encourage everyone to continue to limit their time spent  indoors near potentially infectious people and to not count on or expect a cloth mask or face  covering to protect them or the people around them. The pandemic is not over and will not likely be  over for some time. As states and local jurisdictions reopen, we encourage people to continue to  assess and limit their risks. Cloth masks and face coverings likely do not offer the same degree of  protection as physical distancing, isolation, or limiting personal contact time.  Will face coverings 'flatten the curve' and stop the pandemic?  We have reviewed the many modeling studies that purport to demonstrate that cloth masks or face  coverings have the potential for flattening the curve or significantly decrease the number of cases. These studies fail to recognize several important facts:  • The filter performance of a cloth material does not directly translate or represent its performance on an individual, because it neglects the understanding of fit.  • Cloth masks or coverings come in a variety of shapes, sizes, and materials and are not made  • Transmission is not simply a function of short random interactions between individuals, but  rather a function of particle concentration in the air and the time exposed to that concentration.  • A cloth mask or face covering does very little to prevent the emission or inhalation of small  particles.

In summary, though we support mask wearing by the general public, we continue to conclude that  cloth masks and face coverings are likely to have limited impact on lowering COVID-19  transmission, because they have minimal ability to prevent the emission of small particles, offer  limited personal protection with respect to small particle inhalation, and should not be  recommended as a replacement for physical distancing or reducing time in enclosed spaces with  many potentially infectious people. We are very concerned about messaging that suggests cloth  masks or face coverings can replace physical distancing. We also worry that the public doesn't  understand the limitations of cloth masks and face coverings when we observe how many people  wear their mask under their nose or even under their mouth, remove their masks when talking to  someone nearby, or fail to practice physical distancing when wearing a mask.

In one corner, we have scientists, epidemiologists, infectious-disease physicians, clinicians, engineers—many different experts in the medical community, that is—arguing that the spread of COVID-19 by aerosols (that is, tiny droplets that can remain airborne long enough to travel significantly farther than the six-foot separation we’ve been told to observe) is both real and dangerous. In the other, it’s the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO), which until veryrecently have allowed only that aerosol spread is possible, not necessarily likely. And while watching experts going against governmental agencies isn’t always riveting stuff, this particular battle is terribly important. It has significant implications for how we as a country handle this epidemic, and what decisions we make going forward—and those decisions need to be made sooner, not later. On some level, this is a discussion of droplets versus aerosols. You’ve probably heard plenty this year about droplets: they’re larger in size and may be exhaled by someone talking, shouting, singing, coughing or sneezing. These droplets don’t travel far and fall quickly to the ground, one reason why a “social distance” of roughly six feet is seen as a safe one.

By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today. Aerosols, on the other hand, are tiny by comparison, nearly 10,000 times smaller than a human hair. They’re spread at far greater distances—20 to 30 feet—and can linger in the air for minutes to hours, infecting others. What constitutes a safe distance from aerosols is much harder to define, especially in crowded indoor spaces with poor ventilation. \\nChoosing a safe mask becomes difficult as well: an N95 respirator, for example, would be preferable to an ill-fitting cloth mask when it comes to filtering out these minuscule viral aerosols. For these and other reasons, some in the medical community suspect, our health agencies have been reluctant to accept the data on the airborne transmission of COVID-19—because if they do, they’re acknowledging a problem far more challenging even than what we’ve been dealt with so far. This reluctance has prompted an epic response. In a nearly unprecedented move, 239 scientists from 32 countries wrote an open letter to the WHO in July, urging the agency to recognize that airborne transmission of coronavirus by smaller aerosol particles is possible. The organization’s response was to subsequently update its position, stating that aerosol transmission “cannot be ruled out.” A glowing endorsement this was not—although, points out a spokesperson for the organization, “We have substantial guidance on the topic and speak repeatedly in press conferences and other venues about the importance of keeping indoor spaces well ventilated, precisely because of the potential of aerosol transmission in these settings. WHO has advice in the form of Q&As for the general public, and for people who manage public spaces and buildings and health facilities.” The CDC, meanwhile, posted on its Web site over the weekend that aerosolization may be “the main way the virus spreads,” then backtracked and removed the content from its site, claiming the language had been a draft of some proposed changes which were “posted in error.” This is a major point, not a minor one. Aerosol carry of the virus means that any indoor area where people gather in numbers—think restaurants, bars, churches, schools, rallies—is potentially a spreader of the disease, and depending upon the numbers, a superspreader. These are likely places with poor ventilation, where people not only are close together but may be speaking loudly, shouting, singing, cheering or booing, etc. \\nThe idea of aerosol spread is neither new nor controversial. Several diseases, including measles, chickenpox and tuberculosis, have been shown to be transmitted by aerosols. Patients sick with the flu have the virus in their exhaled breath, and that virus has been shown to be present in the air. This is true for some other viruses, including those found in infants. Scientists in Wuhan, China, have identified coronavirus RNA particles in the air in hospital areas, although they haven’t yet proven that the particles are infectious. Lab workers at the University of Nebraska have published their finding that they, too, have identified coronavirus RNA in the air. “We have pretty strong circumstantial evidence, in a number of these superspreading indoor incidents, that there must have been a significant component of aerosol or airborne transmission,” says William Bahnfleth, chair of the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) Epidemic Task Force. Bahnfleth noted several examples, including a restaurant in Guangzhou, China, where multiple people without direct contact with one another became infected from a single individual, and a choir practice in Washington state where presumed droplet and aerosol spread from singingsickened 53 people, two of whom died. In an e-mail interview, researcher Bjorn Birnir shared his work, published in a preprint (a non–peer reviewed paper), that demonstrated how an infected person continues to exhale a cloud of droplets and aerosols. These “build up over time to dangerous concentrations for everyone in the room,” Birnir says. While we don’t know exactly how much virus is needed to infect people or at what concentrations, these examples show that at some point the threshold is met and inhaled aerosols are the likely culprits. “Aerosol transmission plays a significant role in indoor environments and cannot be neglected,” says environmental science expert Maosheng Yao, a professor of engineering at Peking University. \")], metadata={'suggested_label': array([0.3994863 , 0.05406459, 0.1469628 , 0.3994863 ]), 'llm_type': 'gpt-4o', 'llm_output': {'questions': [{'question': 'What is the effectiveness of masks in blocking respiratory droplets that can carry the novel coronavirus?', 'answer': 'Face masks can dramatically reduce the person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by blocking respiratory droplets.', 'source': '4'}, {'question': 'Do cloth masks offer the same degree of protection as physical distancing?', 'answer': 'Cloth masks likely do not offer the same degree of protection as physical distancing, isolation, or limiting personal contact time.', 'source': '1'}, {'question': 'What is the particle filtration efficiency (PFE) of masks using PTFE as the membrane in the filter layer?', 'answer': 'The PFE of masks using PTFE as the membrane in the filter layer is 88.33% ± 1.80%.', 'source': '0'}, {'question': 'What is the stance of the CDC and WHO on aerosol transmission of COVID-19?', 'answer': 'The CDC and WHO have acknowledged that aerosol transmission is possible but have been reluctant to fully accept it as a significant mode of transmission.', 'source': '2'}, {'question': 'What is the impact of mask-wearing on the growth rate of COVID-19 cases in mask-wearing versus non-mask-wearing groups?', 'answer': 'The Asian mask-wearing group has lower growth rates of COVID-19 cases compared to the non-mask-wearing group.', 'source': '3'}, {'question': 'What are the limitations of cloth masks in preventing COVID-19 transmission?', 'answer': 'Cloth masks have minimal ability to prevent the emission or inhalation of small particles and should not replace physical distancing.', 'source': '1'}, {'question': 'What is the potential reduction in COVID-19 transmission with proper mask usage?', 'answer': 'Proper mask usage could reduce COVID-19 transmission by somewhere between 50% and 85%.', 'source': '4'}, {'question': \"What are the concerns about the public's understanding of the effectiveness of cloth masks?\", 'answer': 'There is concern that the public does not understand the limitations of cloth masks, such as their minimal ability to prevent the emission or inhalation of small particles.', 'source': '1'}, {'question': 'What is the role of aerosols in the transmission of COVID-19?', 'answer': 'Aerosols can linger in the air for minutes to hours and infect others, making them a significant mode of transmission in crowded indoor spaces with poor ventilation.', 'source': '2'}, {'question': 'What is the effectiveness of homemade cloth masks compared to commercial medical masks?', 'answer': 'Homemade cloth masks are not as effective as commercial medical masks.', 'source': '3'}], 'claim_veracity': {'Supported': '2', 'Refuted': '4', 'Not Enough Evidence': '3', 'Conflicting Evidence/Cherrypicking': '4'}}}), retrieval_result=RetrievalResult(documents=[Document(metadata={'url': 'https://aaqr.org/articles/aaqr-20-06-covid-0275', 'context_before': 'The unprecedented demand for masks has now attracted attention on their filtration efficiency. Furthermore, the widespread use of disposable masks has led to shortage of filter materials and problems with their haphazard disposal. In this study, a testing system that is based on standardized methods has been established and enhanced to reliably measure the particle filtration efficiency (PFE) of masks. Quality control experiments that examine the filtration efficiency of polystyrene latex (PSL) particles that are 0.1 µm in size and sodium chloride (NaCl) particles that range from 0.01–1.0 µm are conducted to determine the reliability of the testing system. Moreover, various textile materials are tested to fabricate 3-layer face masks, and the PFE of these masks is tested by using the proposed testing system to find the most suitable materials and the likelihood of their reusability. Among the tested materials, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) used as the membrane in the filter layer has the highest PFE of 88.33% ± 1.80%, which is mainly due to its dense and multilayer structure. The air permeability of the self-developed masks ranges from 1.41 ± 0.04 to 1.93 ± 0.08, less breathable than the commercial masks. The reusability of a mask that uses PTFE as the membrane in the filter layer is tested by gently washing the mask 30 times and then drying the mask in air before the PFE is measured. The PFE is only reduced by 10–20% after 30 washes, thus indicating the potential reusability of the mask. The findings in this study will contribute to reducing the pressure of mask shortages and are an environmentally friendly solution to the massive use of disposable masks. Keywords: COVID-19; Mask testing system; Reusable mask; Particle filtration efficiency. The new coronavirus (COVID-19) has become a global public health concern because it is highly contagious with severe or even fatal health consequences. With the rapid spread of COVID-19, self-protection has become crucial to avoid contracting this disease. ', 'context_after': 'The widespread use of such disposable masks is having a detrimental effect on the environment, as additional resources and human resources are needed to properly dispose of used masks which might otherwise end up in the oceans or landfills. As such, it is timely to develop effective yet reusable masks, not only to address the needs of the current epidemic but also to conserve resources. One of the key parameters of masks is their particle filtration efficiency (PFE) which reflects the ability of masks and/or filters to block the inhalation of different types of particles. Basically, PFE testing follows the methods stipulated in various standards, which include ASTM F2299 (the United States) and YY 0469-2011/GB19083-2010 (Chinese), and the standard provided by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). In ASTM F2299, polystyrene latex (PSL) particles of a specific size are used to evaluate the PFE of a material. Although the applicable particle size range is from 0.1 µm to 5.0 µm, PSL particles of 0.1 µm are generally used for testing as it is the most penetrating particle size. In YY 0469-2011, sodium chloride (NaCl) particles that range from 0.01 µm to 1.0 µm are used as the index in PFE testing of masks, while the NIOSH standard is used to test masks to filter NaCl particles that are 0.3 µm in size. Although these standard methods provide basic instructions and parameters for PFE testing, they do not offer specific settings for testing systems and details of the equipment involved. Moreover, some of the standard methods have limitations. For instance, a device that is recommended for measuring particle concentration (an optical particle counter (OPC)) is low in accuracy and size-resolution (Rengasamy et al., 2011). Moreover, the standards do not strictly stipulate the size of the particles to be tested, thus resulting in differences and uncertainties in the results with the different testing agents and systems. '}, page_content='As a highly infectious disease, the two main routes of transmission include direct transmission (e.g., spraying droplets emitted from aerosolized particles through sneezing, coughing or talking), and indirect transmission (contact with surfaces that contain the virus or objects that have been in contact with an infected individual) (Liu, 2020; Ningthoujam, 2020; Tomar and Gupta, 2020). However, the former has been documented to be a more prevalent form of transmission, so an effective mask must be worn to obstruct the transmission of the virus and block its spread when conducting daily life activities (Bałazy et al., 2006; MacIntyre and Chughtai, 2020). This has led to the unprecedented demand and shortage of masks, along with the problem of ineffective masks. On the one hand, there are a variety of different masks on the market. Although most commercially available masks claim effectiveness against contact with airborne particles, their actual performance has not been tested adequately. For example, Cheng (2020) reported that there was no quality control in face mask production in Pakistan. In Italy, in order to meet the huge demand of face masks, some industries have reset the production chain, shifting from the usual target products to the production of masks. However, the quality of the masks is questionable and needs to be tested (Amendola et al., 2020). In addition, Lam et al. (2020) examined 160 mask brands on the market and found that 48.8% of them were substandard and/or invalid. With COVID-19 as an urgent public health issue now, it has become imperative to test and validate the performance of these masks with reliable testing equipment. On the other hand, COVID-19 has led to the unprecedented demand for masks, which has resulted in a shortage of materials to fabricate them. Moreover, most of the masks currently found on the market are disposable (i.e., surgical, N95 and KF94 masks).

Despite the current limited scientific data detailing their effectiveness, we support the wearing of face coverings by the public when mandated and when in close contact with people whose infection  status they don't know. However, we also encourage everyone to continue to limit their time spent  indoors near potentially infectious people and to not count on or expect a cloth mask or face  covering to protect them or the people around them. The pandemic is not over and will not likely be  over for some time. As states and local jurisdictions reopen, we encourage people to continue to  assess and limit their risks. Cloth masks and face coverings likely do not offer the same degree of  protection as physical distancing, isolation, or limiting personal contact time.  Will face coverings 'flatten the curve' and stop the pandemic?  We have reviewed the many modeling studies that purport to demonstrate that cloth masks or face  coverings have the potential for flattening the curve or significantly decrease the number of cases. These studies fail to recognize several important facts:  • The filter performance of a cloth material does not directly translate or represent its performance on an individual, because it neglects the understanding of fit.  • Cloth masks or coverings come in a variety of shapes, sizes, and materials and are not made  • Transmission is not simply a function of short random interactions between individuals, but  rather a function of particle concentration in the air and the time exposed to that concentration.  • A cloth mask or face covering does very little to prevent the emission or inhalation of small  particles.

In summary, though we support mask wearing by the general public, we continue to conclude that  cloth masks and face coverings are likely to have limited impact on lowering COVID-19  transmission, because they have minimal ability to prevent the emission of small particles, offer  limited personal protection with respect to small particle inhalation, and should not be  recommended as a replacement for physical distancing or reducing time in enclosed spaces with  many potentially infectious people. We are very concerned about messaging that suggests cloth  masks or face coverings can replace physical distancing. We also worry that the public doesn't  understand the limitations of cloth masks and face coverings when we observe how many people  wear their mask under their nose or even under their mouth, remove their masks when talking to  someone nearby, or fail to practice physical distancing when wearing a mask.

In one corner, we have scientists, epidemiologists, infectious-disease physicians, clinicians, engineers—many different experts in the medical community, that is—arguing that the spread of COVID-19 by aerosols (that is, tiny droplets that can remain airborne long enough to travel significantly farther than the six-foot separation we’ve been told to observe) is both real and dangerous. In the other, it’s the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO), which until veryrecently have allowed only that aerosol spread is possible, not necessarily likely. And while watching experts going against governmental agencies isn’t always riveting stuff, this particular battle is terribly important. It has significant implications for how we as a country handle this epidemic, and what decisions we make going forward—and those decisions need to be made sooner, not later. On some level, this is a discussion of droplets versus aerosols. You’ve probably heard plenty this year about droplets: they’re larger in size and may be exhaled by someone talking, shouting, singing, coughing or sneezing. These droplets don’t travel far and fall quickly to the ground, one reason why a “social distance” of roughly six feet is seen as a safe one.

Aerosols, on the other hand, are tiny by comparison, nearly 10,000 times smaller than a human hair. They’re spread at far greater distances—20 to 30 feet—and can linger in the air for minutes to hours, infecting others. What constitutes a safe distance from aerosols is much harder to define, especially in crowded indoor spaces with poor ventilation. \", 'context_after': 'The idea of aerosol spread is neither new nor controversial. Several diseases, including measles, chickenpox and tuberculosis, have been shown to be transmitted by aerosols. Patients sick with the flu have the virus in their exhaled breath, and that virus has been shown to be present in the air. This is true for some other viruses, including those found in infants. Scientists in Wuhan, China, have identified coronavirus RNA particles in the air in hospital areas, although they haven’t yet proven that the particles are infectious. Lab workers at the University of Nebraska have published their finding that they, too, have identified coronavirus RNA in the air. “We have pretty strong circumstantial evidence, in a number of these superspreading indoor incidents, that there must have been a significant component of aerosol or airborne transmission,” says William Bahnfleth, chair of the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) Epidemic Task Force. Bahnfleth noted several examples, including a restaurant in Guangzhou, China, where multiple people without direct contact with one another became infected from a single individual, and a choir practice in Washington state where presumed droplet and aerosol spread from singingsickened 53 people, two of whom died. In an e-mail interview, researcher Bjorn Birnir shared his work, published in a preprint (a non–peer reviewed paper), that demonstrated how an infected person continues to exhale a cloud of droplets and aerosols.

'}, page_content='Choosing a safe mask becomes difficult as well: an N95 respirator, for example, would be preferable to an ill-fitting cloth mask when it comes to filtering out these minuscule viral aerosols. For these and other reasons, some in the medical community suspect, our health agencies have been reluctant to accept the data on the airborne transmission of COVID-19—because if they do, they’re acknowledging a problem far more challenging even than what we’ve been dealt with so far. This reluctance has prompted an epic response. In a nearly unprecedented move, 239 scientists from 32 countries wrote an open letter to the WHO in July, urging the agency to recognize that airborne transmission of coronavirus by smaller aerosol particles is possible. The organization’s response was to subsequently update its position, stating that aerosol transmission “cannot be ruled out.” A glowing endorsement this was not—although, points out a spokesperson for the organization, “We have substantial guidance on the topic and speak repeatedly in press conferences and other venues about the importance of keeping indoor spaces well ventilated, precisely because of the potential of aerosol transmission in these settings. WHO has advice in the form of Q&As for the general public, and for people who manage public spaces and buildings and health facilities.” The CDC, meanwhile, posted on its Web site over the weekend that aerosolization may be “the main way the virus spreads,” then backtracked and removed the content from its site, claiming the language had been a draft of some proposed changes which were “posted in error.” This is a major point, not a minor one. Aerosol carry of the virus means that any indoor area where people gather in numbers—think restaurants, bars, churches, schools, rallies—is potentially a spreader of the disease, and depending upon the numbers, a superspreader. These are likely places with poor ventilation, where people not only are close together but may be speaking loudly, shouting, singing, cheering or booing, etc. '), Document(metadata={'url': 'https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0237691', 'context_before': 'A log transformed analysis is conducted to evaluate the growth rate of COVID-19 infections. ANOVA analysis is used to analyze the group effect. The p value is less than 2e-16 for the log 2 transformed case comparison, suggesting that the two groups are statistically significantly different. The Asian mask-wearing group clearly has lower growth rates of COVID-19 cases compared to the non-mask-wearing group. Thailand has the highest growth rate among the mask-wearing groups. However, the differences in the growth rate of confirmed cases between these two groups cannot be fully attributed to mask-wearing, but arise from many factors, such as clinical tests performed, complicated social, economic, and cultural differences, and varied public health polices enforcement. The preliminary comparison only provides the rationale to further evaluate if wearing masks is effective for controlling the infectious disease outbreak. Our study has six major assumptions with preliminary evidence. First, the SARS-CoV-2 transmission pathway includes airborne [1, 8, 22–24] with an R0 value exceeding that of influenza and SARS [16, 32, 33]. Second, a proportion of infected cases could be asymptomatic [36, 38, 46, 47]. Third, asymptomatic individuals could transfer the virus in the community [48, 49, 82]. Fourth, the public awareness of mask usage may increase as the pandemic spreads [64]. Fifth, the market could respond to consumer demand with a production increase and without supply chain problems [67]. Sixth, homemade cloth masks are not as effective as commercial medical masks [57, 60]. Thus, we project the best scenario as the pandemic spreads and by the end of the outbreak, the general population will be willing to wear a mask. Although wearing a mask is a low-cost and non-disruptive measure, wearing a mask has not been culturally widespread in many parts of the world [83]. Furthermore, for non-certified medical masks, individual errors could lead to ineffective mask fitting, which could reduce the benefit of wearing a mask [84]. ', 'context_after': 'However, masks do not replace social distancing and other personal hygiene practices, such as hand washing. The effectiveness of any NPIs depends on compliance rates, contact rate reduction, the role of children, and asymptomatic cases in transmission. Our model analyzes the impact of wearing a mask that can efficiently filter viral aerosols during the COVID-19 pandemic in the general population. Our study suggests that wearing a quality mask in combination with other NPIs can support hospital resource management during a pandemic. In a free market, the risks of not having enough masks for the general population may negatively impact timely responses to the outbreak. Appropriate public health policies and government subsidies could be necessary to manage similar crises in the future. Future studies on how to improve adherence and compliance rates will better position society for potential future respiratory disease outbreaks when the viral agent has a similar clinical attack rate. - 1.

First, a recent study suggested that the virus was detected on the outer layer of COVID-19 patients' masks [85], which could invalidate the utility of a patient wearing a mask. However, although the virus was detected, the mask could still provide prevention by reducing the virus load to an adjacent healthy individual. Further studies on asymptomatic individuals wearing masks could be more convincing to validate the effectiveness of wearing a mask to prevent pre-symptomatic transmission. Second, we assume random mixing and model the general population, but have not taken account children's role. Children are less likely to wear masks consistently to realize mask effectiveness. At the same time, the role of children in COVID-19 transmission is unclear [86]. Third, we assume the willing individual who has a mask can use the mask in the right manner and follow social distancing and other personal hygiene practices. There are discrepancies between willingness, perceived compliance, and real compliance [87]. Fourth, research shows that masks can be a source of contamination if not disposed of or replaced in timely manner The COVID-19 pandemic has created a global crisis. Prevention such as vaccines is one of the most effective measures to mitigate such a catastrophic public health crisis. Prior to an available vaccine, NPIs such as wearing a mask can potentially reduce the virus transmission rate. Recent modeling studies suggest that timely and comprehensive NPIs are needed to prevent a secondary wave of COVID-19 [89]. However, timely implementations of NPI such as wearing a mask call for public awareness, a readily available market stockpile, and government advocacy and policies. For respiratory diseases caused by a rival agent through aerosol and droplet transmission routes, wearing masks could be a reasonable NPI to reduce the virus transmission efficiency and secondary transmission [5, 89]. \"), Document(metadata={'url': 'https://time.com/5861295/masks-covid19-spread-fighting/', 'context_before': '', 'context_after': 'Taking their cues from President Trump, who has refused to appear on camera wearing a face mask and has said that Americans who wear masks are doing so to show their disapproval of him, many of his supporters now see wearing a face mask as an affront to personal liberty. According to the Washington Post, Republican leaders “are less likely to mandate them, and Republican voters are more likely to forgo, and even scorn, them.” Health officials who have promoted mask mandates have quit their jobs after receiving death threats. As a result of this alarming polarization, only 18 states and the District of Columbia are mandating face masks in public across the whole state. Only two—Massachusetts and Maryland—have Republican governors. Meanwhile, many Republican-led states are actively trying to subvert local measures. Nebraska Governor Pete Ricketts has gone so far as to say he will withhold federal coronavirus relief funds from local governments if they try and mandate mask use in their places of work. Rejecting face masks inevitably means embracing more COVID-19 cases and deaths. One U.S. study found that states with a mandate had a more rapid decline in daily growth rates of COVID-19 and estimated that mask use prevented up to 450,000 cases of COVID-19 by May 22, 2020. And while researchers at the University of Washington now predict that the U.S. could reach 180,000 COVID-19 deaths by October, they say we could prevent 33,000 of these deaths—more than half of the new deaths the model projects—if at least 95% of people wear a mask. That’s right. We can avert the deaths of 33,000 of our parents, grandparents, siblings, co-workers, teachers, bus drivers, mail carriers, nurses and store and factory workers by just sticking a one-dollar piece of cloth over our noses and mouths. So what’s stopping us? One problem is the “me first” culture in the U.S., in which anti-maskers claim that their right to go around unmasked in public matters more than saving lives. '}, page_content='At long last, we have made a truly game-changing scientific breakthrough in preventing the spread of COVID-19. The impact of this breakthrough seems almost too good to be true. We have found a disease control tool that, when used properly, can dramatically reduce the person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Studies have shown that this tool could reduce transmission by somewhere between 50% and 85%. The tool is cheap and remarkably low-tech. You can even make one at home. It has no significant side effects. And with each passing day, the scientific research showing the tool’s effectiveness gets stronger and stronger. If this tool were a vaccine or medicine, we’d be high-fiving each other and popping the champagne, knowing we’d discovered a crucial means to help prevent the spread of the pandemic. I’m talking, of course, about face masks—cloth, surgical, or even a bandanna. Face masks block the spread of respiratory droplets that can carry the novel coronavirus. But just as with so many other aspects of the response to COVID-19—including mass testing, contact tracing, and the early use of stay-at-home orders—the U.S. is once again squandering this opportunity. In many countries that have so far successfully controlled their COVID-19 epidemics, public health leaders, politicians, and the public have fully embraced the use of face masks with no hint of controversy. A recent study found that countries where masks were widely used soon after their COVID-19 outbreak began were more likely to keep their death rates low and to have a shorter outbreak. Countries like Hong Kong, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam that quickly adopted masking, along with other control measures such as social distancing and track and trace, have reported fewer than 6 deaths per million residents as a result of COVID-19.

       "   'scraped_text': \"A log transformed analysis is conducted to evaluate the growth rate of COVID-19 infections. ANOVA analysis is used to analyze the group effect. The p value is less than 2e-16 for the log 2 transformed case comparison, suggesting that the two groups are statistically significantly different. The Asian mask-wearing group clearly has lower growth rates of COVID-19 cases compared to the non-mask-wearing group. Thailand has the highest growth rate among the mask-wearing groups. However, the differences in the growth rate of confirmed cases between these two groups cannot be fully attributed to mask-wearing, but arise from many factors, such as clinical tests performed, complicated social, economic, and cultural differences, and varied public health polices enforcement. The preliminary comparison only provides the rationale to further evaluate if wearing masks is effective for controlling the infectious disease outbreak. Our study has six major assumptions with preliminary evidence. First, the SARS-CoV-2 transmission pathway includes airborne [1, 8, 22–24] with an R0 value exceeding that of influenza and SARS [16, 32, 33]. Second, a proportion of infected cases could be asymptomatic [36, 38, 46, 47]. Third, asymptomatic individuals could transfer the virus in the community [48, 49, 82]. Fourth, the public awareness of mask usage may increase as the pandemic spreads [64]. Fifth, the market could respond to consumer demand with a production increase and without supply chain problems [67]. Sixth, homemade cloth masks are not as effective as commercial medical masks [57, 60]. Thus, we project the best scenario as the pandemic spreads and by the end of the outbreak, the general population will be willing to wear a mask. Although wearing a mask is a low-cost and non-disruptive measure, wearing a mask has not been culturally widespread in many parts of the world [83]. Furthermore, for non-certified medical masks, individual errors could lead to ineffective mask fitting, which could reduce the benefit of wearing a mask [84]. \\nThere are limitations to those six assumptions. First, a recent study suggested that the virus was detected on the outer layer of COVID-19 patients' masks [85], which could invalidate the utility of a patient wearing a mask. However, although the virus was detected, the mask could still provide prevention by reducing the virus load to an adjacent healthy individual. Further studies on asymptomatic individuals wearing masks could be more convincing to validate the effectiveness of wearing a mask to prevent pre-symptomatic transmission. Second, we assume random mixing and model the general population, but have not taken account children's role. Children are less likely to wear masks consistently to realize mask effectiveness. At the same time, the role of children in COVID-19 transmission is unclear [86]. Third, we assume the willing individual who has a mask can use the mask in the right manner and follow social distancing and other personal hygiene practices. There are discrepancies between willingness, perceived compliance, and real compliance [87]. Fourth, research shows that masks can be a source of contamination if not disposed of or replaced in timely manner The COVID-19 pandemic has created a global crisis. Prevention such as vaccines is one of the most effective measures to mitigate such a catastrophic public health crisis. Prior to an available vaccine, NPIs such as wearing a mask can potentially reduce the virus transmission rate. Recent modeling studies suggest that timely and comprehensive NPIs are needed to prevent a secondary wave of COVID-19 [89]. However, timely implementations of NPI such as wearing a mask call for public awareness, a readily available market stockpile, and government advocacy and policies. For respiratory diseases caused by a rival agent through aerosol and droplet transmission routes, wearing masks could be a reasonable NPI to reduce the virus transmission efficiency and secondary transmission [5, 89]. \\nHowever, masks do not replace social distancing and other personal hygiene practices, such as hand washing. The effectiveness of any NPIs depends on compliance rates, contact rate reduction, the role of children, and asymptomatic cases in transmission. Our model analyzes the impact of wearing a mask that can efficiently filter viral aerosols during the COVID-19 pandemic in the general population. Our study suggests that wearing a quality mask in combination with other NPIs can support hospital resource management during a pandemic. In a free market, the risks of not having enough masks for the general population may negatively impact timely responses to the outbreak. Appropriate public health policies and government subsidies could be necessary to manage similar crises in the future. Future studies on how to improve adherence and compliance rates will better position society for potential future respiratory disease outbreaks when the viral agent has a similar clinical attack rate. - 1.

Furthermore, the widespread use of disposable masks has led to shortage of filter materials and problems with their haphazard disposal. In this study, a testing system that is based on standardized methods has been established and enhanced to reliably measure the particle filtration efficiency (PFE) of masks. Quality control experiments that examine the filtration efficiency of polystyrene latex (PSL) particles that are 0.1 µm in size and sodium chloride (NaCl) particles that range from 0.01–1.0 µm are conducted to determine the reliability of the testing system. Moreover, various textile materials are tested to fabricate 3-layer face masks, and the PFE of these masks is tested by using the proposed testing system to find the most suitable materials and the likelihood of their reusability. Among the tested materials, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) used as the membrane in the filter layer has the highest PFE of 88.33% ± 1.80%, which is mainly due to its dense and multilayer structure. The air permeability of the self-developed masks ranges from 1.41 ± 0.04 to 1.93 ± 0.08, less breathable than the commercial masks. The reusability of a mask that uses PTFE as the membrane in the filter layer is tested by gently washing the mask 30 times and then drying the mask in air before the PFE is measured. The PFE is only reduced by 10–20% after 30 washes, thus indicating the potential reusability of the mask. The findings in this study will contribute to reducing the pressure of mask shortages and are an environmentally friendly solution to the massive use of disposable masks. Keywords: COVID-19; Mask testing system; Reusable mask; Particle filtration efficiency. The new coronavirus (COVID-19) has become a global public health concern because it is highly contagious with severe or even fatal health consequences. With the rapid spread of COVID-19, self-protection has become crucial to avoid contracting this disease. \\nAs a highly infectious disease, the two main routes of transmission include direct transmission (e.g., spraying droplets emitted from aerosolized particles through sneezing, coughing or talking), and indirect transmission (contact with surfaces that contain the virus or objects that have been in contact with an infected individual) (Liu, 2020; Ningthoujam, 2020; Tomar and Gupta, 2020). However, the former has been documented to be a more prevalent form of transmission, so an effective mask must be worn to obstruct the transmission of the virus and block its spread when conducting daily life activities (Bałazy et al., 2006; MacIntyre and Chughtai, 2020). This has led to the unprecedented demand and shortage of masks, along with the problem of ineffective masks. On the one hand, there are a variety of different masks on the market. Although most commercially available masks claim effectiveness against contact with airborne particles, their actual performance has not been tested adequately. For example, Cheng (2020) reported that there was no quality control in face mask production in Pakistan. In Italy, in order to meet the huge demand of face masks, some industries have reset the production chain, shifting from the usual target products to the production of masks. However, the quality of the masks is questionable and needs to be tested (Amendola et al., 2020). In addition, Lam et al. (2020) examined 160 mask brands on the market and found that 48.8% of them were substandard and/or invalid. With COVID-19 as an urgent public health issue now, it has become imperative to test and validate the performance of these masks with reliable testing equipment. On the other hand, COVID-19 has led to the unprecedented demand for masks, which has resulted in a shortage of materials to fabricate them. Moreover, most of the masks currently found on the market are disposable (i.e., surgical, N95 and KF94 masks). \\nThe widespread use of such disposable masks is having a detrimental effect on the environment, as additional resources and human resources are needed to properly dispose of used masks which might otherwise end up in the oceans or landfills. As such, it is timely to develop effective yet reusable masks, not only to address the needs of the current epidemic but also to conserve resources. One of the key parameters of masks is their particle filtration efficiency (PFE) which reflects the ability of masks and/or filters to block the inhalation of different types of particles. Basically, PFE testing follows the methods stipulated in various standards, which include ASTM F2299 (the United States) and YY 0469-2011/GB19083-2010 (Chinese), and the standard provided by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). In ASTM F2299, polystyrene latex (PSL) particles of a specific size are used to evaluate the PFE of a material. Although the applicable particle size range is from 0.1 µm to 5.0 µm, PSL particles of 0.1 µm are generally used for testing as it is the most penetrating particle size. In YY 0469-2011, sodium chloride (NaCl) particles that range from 0.01 µm to 1.0 µm are used as the index in PFE testing of masks, while the NIOSH standard is used to test masks to filter NaCl particles that are 0.3 µm in size. Although these standard methods provide basic instructions and parameters for PFE testing, they do not offer specific settings for testing systems and details of the equipment involved. Moreover, some of the standard methods have limitations. For instance, a device that is recommended for measuring particle concentration (an optical particle counter (OPC)) is low in accuracy and size-resolution (Rengasamy et al., 2011). Moreover, the standards do not strictly stipulate the size of the particles to be tested, thus resulting in differences and uncertainties in the results with the different testing agents and systems.

       "   'scraped_text': '\\nAt long last, we have made a truly game-changing scientific breakthrough in preventing the spread of COVID-19. The impact of this breakthrough seems almost too good to be true. We have found a disease control tool that, when used properly, can dramatically reduce the person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Studies have shown that this tool could reduce transmission by somewhere between 50% and 85%. The tool is cheap and remarkably low-tech. You can even make one at home. It has no significant side effects. And with each passing day, the scientific research showing the tool’s effectiveness gets stronger and stronger. If this tool were a vaccine or medicine, we’d be high-fiving each other and popping the champagne, knowing we’d discovered a crucial means to help prevent the spread of the pandemic. I’m talking, of course, about face masks—cloth, surgical, or even a bandanna. Face masks block the spread of respiratory droplets that can carry the novel coronavirus. But just as with so many other aspects of the response to COVID-19—including mass testing, contact tracing, and the early use of stay-at-home orders—the U.S. is once again squandering this opportunity. In many countries that have so far successfully controlled their COVID-19 epidemics, public health leaders, politicians, and the public have fully embraced the use of face masks with no hint of controversy. A recent study found that countries where masks were widely used soon after their COVID-19 outbreak began were more likely to keep their death rates low and to have a shorter outbreak. Countries like Hong Kong, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam that quickly adopted masking, along with other control measures such as social distancing and track and trace, have reported fewer than 6 deaths per million residents as a result of COVID-19. Yet in the U.S., where the death rate from COVID-19 is now 379 per million people, face masks have been weaponized for partisan purposes. \\nTaking their cues from President Trump, who has refused to appear on camera wearing a face mask and has said that Americans who wear masks are doing so to show their disapproval of him, many of his supporters now see wearing a face mask as an affront to personal liberty. According to the Washington Post, Republican leaders “are less likely to mandate them, and Republican voters are more likely to forgo, and even scorn, them.” Health officials who have promoted mask mandates have quit their jobs after receiving death threats. As a result of this alarming polarization, only 18 states and the District of Columbia are mandating face masks in public across the whole state. Only two—Massachusetts and Maryland—have Republican governors. Meanwhile, many Republican-led states are actively trying to subvert local measures. Nebraska Governor Pete Ricketts has gone so far as to say he will withhold federal coronavirus relief funds from local governments if they try and mandate mask use in their places of work. Rejecting face masks inevitably means embracing more COVID-19 cases and deaths. One U.S. study found that states with a mandate had a more rapid decline in daily growth rates of COVID-19 and estimated that mask use prevented up to 450,000 cases of COVID-19 by May 22, 2020. And while researchers at the University of Washington now predict that the U.S. could reach 180,000 COVID-19 deaths by October, they say we could prevent 33,000 of these deaths—more than half of the new deaths the model projects—if at least 95% of people wear a mask. That’s right. We can avert the deaths of 33,000 of our parents, grandparents, siblings, co-workers, teachers, bus drivers, mail carriers, nurses and store and factory workers by just sticking a one-dollar piece of cloth over our noses and mouths. So what’s stopping us? One problem is the “me first” culture in the U.S., in which anti-maskers claim that their right to go around unmasked in public matters more than saving lives. '},\n",

Despite the current limited scientific data detailing their effectiveness, we support the wearing of face coverings by the public when mandated and when in close contact with people whose infection  status they don't know. However, we also encourage everyone to continue to limit their time spent  indoors near potentially infectious people and to not count on or expect a cloth mask or face  covering to protect them or the people around them. The pandemic is not over and will not likely be  over for some time. As states and local jurisdictions reopen, we encourage people to continue to  assess and limit their risks. Cloth masks and face coverings likely do not offer the same degree of  protection as physical distancing, isolation, or limiting personal contact time.  Will face coverings 'flatten the curve' and stop the pandemic?  We have reviewed the many modeling studies that purport to demonstrate that cloth masks or face  coverings have the potential for flattening the curve or significantly decrease the number of cases. These studies fail to recognize several important facts:  • The filter performance of a cloth material does not directly translate or represent its performance on an individual, because it neglects the understanding of fit.  • Cloth masks or coverings come in a variety of shapes, sizes, and materials and are not made  • Transmission is not simply a function of short random interactions between individuals, but  rather a function of particle concentration in the air and the time exposed to that concentration.  • A cloth mask or face covering does very little to prevent the emission or inhalation of small  particles.

COMMENTARY: Masks-for-all for COVID-19 not based on sound data I CIDRAP  small infectious particles is not only biologically plausible, but the epidemiology supports it as an important mode of transmission for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.  In summary, though we support mask wearing by the general public, we continue to conclude that  cloth masks and face coverings are likely to have limited impact on lowering COVID-19  transmission, because they have minimal ability to prevent the emission of small particles, offer  limited personal protection with respect to small particle inhalation, and should not be  recommended as a replacement for physical distancing or reducing time in enclosed spaces with  many potentially infectious people. We are very concerned about messaging that suggests cloth  masks or face coverings can replace physical distancing. We also worry that the public doesn't  understand the limitations of cloth masks and face coverings when we observe how many people  wear their mask under their nose or even under their mouth, remove their masks when talking to  someone nearby, or fail to practice physical distancing when wearing a mask.

       "   'scraped_text': \"This feels like a lopsided fight. In one corner, we have scientists, epidemiologists, infectious-disease physicians, clinicians, engineers—many different experts in the medical community, that is—arguing that the spread of COVID-19 by aerosols (that is, tiny droplets that can remain airborne long enough to travel significantly farther than the six-foot separation we’ve been told to observe) is both real and dangerous. In the other, it’s the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO), which until veryrecently have allowed only that aerosol spread is possible, not necessarily likely. And while watching experts going against governmental agencies isn’t always riveting stuff, this particular battle is terribly important. It has significant implications for how we as a country handle this epidemic, and what decisions we make going forward—and those decisions need to be made sooner, not later. On some level, this is a discussion of droplets versus aerosols. You’ve probably heard plenty this year about droplets: they’re larger in size and may be exhaled by someone talking, shouting, singing, coughing or sneezing. These droplets don’t travel far and fall quickly to the ground, one reason why a “social distance” of roughly six feet is seen as a safe one. If you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today. Aerosols, on the other hand, are tiny by comparison, nearly 10,000 times smaller than a human hair. They’re spread at far greater distances—20 to 30 feet—and can linger in the air for minutes to hours, infecting others. What constitutes a safe distance from aerosols is much harder to define, especially in crowded indoor spaces with poor ventilation. \\nChoosing a safe mask becomes difficult as well: an N95 respirator, for example, would be preferable to an ill-fitting cloth mask when it comes to filtering out these minuscule viral aerosols. For these and other reasons, some in the medical community suspect, our health agencies have been reluctant to accept the data on the airborne transmission of COVID-19—because if they do, they’re acknowledging a problem far more challenging even than what we’ve been dealt with so far. This reluctance has prompted an epic response. In a nearly unprecedented move, 239 scientists from 32 countries wrote an open letter to the WHO in July, urging the agency to recognize that airborne transmission of coronavirus by smaller aerosol particles is possible. The organization’s response was to subsequently update its position, stating that aerosol transmission “cannot be ruled out.” A glowing endorsement this was not—although, points out a spokesperson for the organization, “We have substantial guidance on the topic and speak repeatedly in press conferences and other venues about the importance of keeping indoor spaces well ventilated, precisely because of the potential of aerosol transmission in these settings. WHO has advice in the form of Q&As for the general public, and for people who manage public spaces and buildings and health facilities.” The CDC, meanwhile, posted on its Web site over the weekend that aerosolization may be “the main way the virus spreads,” then backtracked and removed the content from its site, claiming the language had been a draft of some proposed changes which were “posted in error.” This is a major point, not a minor one. Aerosol carry of the virus means that any indoor area where people gather in numbers—think restaurants, bars, churches, schools, rallies—is potentially a spreader of the disease, and depending upon the numbers, a superspreader. These are likely places with poor ventilation, where people not only are close together but may be speaking loudly, shouting, singing, cheering or booing, etc. \\nThe idea of aerosol spread is neither new nor controversial. Several diseases, including measles, chickenpox and tuberculosis, have been shown to be transmitted by aerosols. Patients sick with the flu have the virus in their exhaled breath, and that virus has been shown to be present in the air. This is true for some other viruses, including those found in infants. Scientists in Wuhan, China, have identified coronavirus RNA particles in the air in hospital areas, although they haven’t yet proven that the particles are infectious. Lab workers at the University of Nebraska have published their finding that they, too, have identified coronavirus RNA in the air. “We have pretty strong circumstantial evidence, in a number of these superspreading indoor incidents, that there must have been a significant component of aerosol or airborne transmission,” says William Bahnfleth, chair of the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) Epidemic Task Force. Bahnfleth noted several examples, including a restaurant in Guangzhou, China, where multiple people without direct contact with one another became infected from a single individual, and a choir practice in Washington state where presumed droplet and aerosol spread from singingsickened 53 people, two of whom died. In an e-mail interview, researcher Bjorn Birnir shared his work, published in a preprint (a non–peer reviewed paper), that demonstrated how an infected person continues to exhale a cloud of droplets and aerosols. These “build up over time to dangerous concentrations for everyone in the room,” Birnir says. While we don’t know exactly how much virus is needed to infect people or at what concentrations, these examples show that at some point the threshold is met and inhaled aerosols are the likely culprits. “Aerosol transmission plays a significant role in indoor environments and cannot be neglected,” says environmental science expert Maosheng Yao, a professor of engineering at Peking University. \"},\n",

The reusability of a mask that uses PTFE as the membrane in the filter layer is tested by gently washing the mask 30 times and then drying the mask in air before the PFE is measured. The PFE is only reduced by 10–20% after 30 washes, thus indicating the potential reusability of the mask. The findings in this study will contribute to reducing the pressure of mask shortages and are an environmentally friendly solution to the massive use of disposable masks. Keywords: COVID-19; Mask testing system; Reusable mask; Particle filtration efficiency. The new coronavirus (COVID-19) has become a global public health concern because it is highly contagious with severe or even fatal health consequences. With the rapid spread of COVID-19, self-protection has become crucial to avoid contracting this disease. \\nAs a highly infectious disease, the two main routes of transmission include direct transmission (e.g., spraying droplets emitted from aerosolized particles through sneezing, coughing or talking), and indirect transmission (contact with surfaces that contain the virus or objects that have been in contact with an infected individual) (Liu, 2020; Ningthoujam, 2020; Tomar and Gupta, 2020). However, the former has been documented to be a more prevalent form of transmission, so an effective mask must be worn to obstruct the transmission of the virus and block its spread when conducting daily life activities (Bałazy et al., 2006; MacIntyre and Chughtai, 2020). This has led to the unprecedented demand and shortage of masks, along with the problem of ineffective masks. On the one hand, there are a variety of different masks on the market. Although most commercially available masks claim effectiveness against contact with airborne particles, their actual performance has not been tested adequately. For example, Cheng (2020) reported that there was no quality control in face mask production in Pakistan. In Italy, in order to meet the huge demand of face masks, some industries have reset the production chain, shifting from the usual target products to the production of masks. However, the quality of the masks is questionable and needs to be tested (Amendola et al., 2020). In addition, Lam et al. (2020) examined 160 mask brands on the market and found that 48.8% of them were substandard and/or invalid. With COVID-19 as an urgent public health issue now, it has become imperative to test and validate the performance of these masks with reliable testing equipment. On the other hand, COVID-19 has led to the unprecedented demand for masks, which has resulted in a shortage of materials to fabricate them. Moreover, most of the masks currently found on the market are disposable (i.e., surgical, N95 and KF94 masks). \\nThe widespread use of such disposable masks is having a detrimental effect on the environment, as additional resources and human resources are needed to properly dispose of used masks which might otherwise end up in the oceans or landfills. As such, it is timely to develop effective yet reusable masks, not only to address the needs of the current epidemic but also to conserve resources. One of the key parameters of masks is their particle filtration efficiency (PFE) which reflects the ability of masks and/or filters to block the inhalation of different types of particles. Basically, PFE testing follows the methods stipulated in various standards, which include ASTM F2299 (the United States) and YY 0469-2011/GB19083-2010 (Chinese), and the standard provided by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). In ASTM F2299, polystyrene latex (PSL) particles of a specific size are used to evaluate the PFE of a material. Although the applicable particle size range is from 0.1 µm to 5.0 µm, PSL particles of 0.1 µm are generally used for testing as it is the most penetrating particle size. In YY 0469-2011, sodium chloride (NaCl) particles that range from 0.01 µm to 1.0 µm are used as the index in PFE testing of masks, while the NIOSH standard is used to test masks to filter NaCl particles that are 0.3 µm in size. Although these standard methods provide basic instructions and parameters for PFE testing, they do not offer specific settings for testing systems and details of the equipment involved. Moreover, some of the standard methods have limitations. For instance, a device that is recommended for measuring particle concentration (an optical particle counter (OPC)) is low in accuracy and size-resolution (Rengasamy et al., 2011). Moreover, the standards do not strictly stipulate the size of the particles to be tested, thus resulting in differences and uncertainties in the results with the different testing agents and systems.

       "   'scraped_text': \"A log transformed analysis is conducted to evaluate the growth rate of COVID-19 infections. ANOVA analysis is used to analyze the group effect. The p value is less than 2e-16 for the log 2 transformed case comparison, suggesting that the two groups are statistically significantly different. The Asian mask-wearing group clearly has lower growth rates of COVID-19 cases compared to the non-mask-wearing group. Thailand has the highest growth rate among the mask-wearing groups. However, the differences in the growth rate of confirmed cases between these two groups cannot be fully attributed to mask-wearing, but arise from many factors, such as clinical tests performed, complicated social, economic, and cultural differences, and varied public health polices enforcement. The preliminary comparison only provides the rationale to further evaluate if wearing masks is effective for controlling the infectious disease outbreak. Our study has six major assumptions with preliminary evidence. First, the SARS-CoV-2 transmission pathway includes airborne [1, 8, 22–24] with an R0 value exceeding that of influenza and SARS [16, 32, 33]. Second, a proportion of infected cases could be asymptomatic [36, 38, 46, 47]. Third, asymptomatic individuals could transfer the virus in the community [48, 49, 82]. Fourth, the public awareness of mask usage may increase as the pandemic spreads [64]. Fifth, the market could respond to consumer demand with a production increase and without supply chain problems [67]. Sixth, homemade cloth masks are not as effective as commercial medical masks [57, 60]. Thus, we project the best scenario as the pandemic spreads and by the end of the outbreak, the general population will be willing to wear a mask. Although wearing a mask is a low-cost and non-disruptive measure, wearing a mask has not been culturally widespread in many parts of the world [83]. Furthermore, for non-certified medical masks, individual errors could lead to ineffective mask fitting, which could reduce the benefit of wearing a mask [84]. \\nThere are limitations to those six assumptions. First, a recent study suggested that the virus was detected on the outer layer of COVID-19 patients' masks [85], which could invalidate the utility of a patient wearing a mask. However, although the virus was detected, the mask could still provide prevention by reducing the virus load to an adjacent healthy individual. Further studies on asymptomatic individuals wearing masks could be more convincing to validate the effectiveness of wearing a mask to prevent pre-symptomatic transmission. Second, we assume random mixing and model the general population, but have not taken account children's role. Children are less likely to wear masks consistently to realize mask effectiveness. At the same time, the role of children in COVID-19 transmission is unclear [86]. Third, we assume the willing individual who has a mask can use the mask in the right manner and follow social distancing and other personal hygiene practices. There are discrepancies between willingness, perceived compliance, and real compliance [87]. Fourth, research shows that masks can be a source of contamination if not disposed of or replaced in timely manner The COVID-19 pandemic has created a global crisis. Prevention such as vaccines is one of the most effective measures to mitigate such a catastrophic public health crisis. Prior to an available vaccine, NPIs such as wearing a mask can potentially reduce the virus transmission rate. Recent modeling studies suggest that timely and comprehensive NPIs are needed to prevent a secondary wave of COVID-19 [89]. However, timely implementations of NPI such as wearing a mask call for public awareness, a readily available market stockpile, and government advocacy and policies. For respiratory diseases caused by a rival agent through aerosol and droplet transmission routes, wearing masks could be a reasonable NPI to reduce the virus transmission efficiency and secondary transmission [5, 89]. \\nHowever, masks do not replace social distancing and other personal hygiene practices, such as hand washing. The effectiveness of any NPIs depends on compliance rates, contact rate reduction, the role of children, and asymptomatic cases in transmission. Our model analyzes the impact of wearing a mask that can efficiently filter viral aerosols during the COVID-19 pandemic in the general population. Our study suggests that wearing a quality mask in combination with other NPIs can support hospital resource management during a pandemic. In a free market, the risks of not having enough masks for the general population may negatively impact timely responses to the outbreak. Appropriate public health policies and government subsidies could be necessary to manage similar crises in the future. Future studies on how to improve adherence and compliance rates will better position society for potential future respiratory disease outbreaks when the viral agent has a similar clinical attack rate. - 1.

In this study, a testing system that is based on standardized methods has been established and enhanced to reliably measure the particle filtration efficiency (PFE) of masks. Quality control experiments that examine the filtration efficiency of polystyrene latex (PSL) particles that are 0.1 µm in size and sodium chloride (NaCl) particles that range from 0.01–1.0 µm are conducted to determine the reliability of the testing system. Moreover, various textile materials are tested to fabricate 3-layer face masks, and the PFE of these masks is tested by using the proposed testing system to find the most suitable materials and the likelihood of their reusability.

Despite the current limited scientific data detailing their effectiveness, we support the wearing of face coverings by the public when mandated and when in close contact with people whose infection  status they don't know. However, we also encourage everyone to continue to limit their time spent  indoors near potentially infectious people and to not count on or expect a cloth mask or face  covering to protect them or the people around them. The pandemic is not over and will not likely be  over for some time. As states and local jurisdictions reopen, we encourage people to continue to  assess and limit their risks. Cloth masks and face coverings likely do not offer the same degree of  protection as physical distancing, isolation, or limiting personal contact time.  Will face coverings 'flatten the curve' and stop the pandemic?  We have reviewed the many modeling studies that purport to demonstrate that cloth masks or face  coverings have the potential for flattening the curve or significantly decrease the number of cases. These studies fail to recognize several important facts:  • The filter performance of a cloth material does not directly translate or represent its performance on an individual, because it neglects the understanding of fit.  • Cloth masks or coverings come in a variety of shapes, sizes, and materials and are not made  • Transmission is not simply a function of short random interactions between individuals, but  rather a function of particle concentration in the air and the time exposed to that concentration.  • A cloth mask or face covering does very little to prevent the emission or inhalation of small  particles.

In summary, though we support mask wearing by the general public, we continue to conclude that  cloth masks and face coverings are likely to have limited impact on lowering COVID-19  transmission, because they have minimal ability to prevent the emission of small particles, offer  limited personal protection with respect to small particle inhalation, and should not be  recommended as a replacement for physical distancing or reducing time in enclosed spaces with  many potentially infectious people. We are very concerned about messaging that suggests cloth  masks or face coverings can replace physical distancing. We also worry that the public doesn't  understand the limitations of cloth masks and face coverings when we observe how many people  wear their mask under their nose or even under their mouth, remove their masks when talking to  someone nearby, or fail to practice physical distancing when wearing a mask.

       "   'scraped_text': \"This feels like a lopsided fight. In one corner, we have scientists, epidemiologists, infectious-disease physicians, clinicians, engineers—many different experts in the medical community, that is—arguing that the spread of COVID-19 by aerosols (that is, tiny droplets that can remain airborne long enough to travel significantly farther than the six-foot separation we’ve been told to observe) is both real and dangerous. In the other, it’s the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO), which until veryrecently have allowed only that aerosol spread is possible, not necessarily likely. And while watching experts going against governmental agencies isn’t always riveting stuff, this particular battle is terribly important. It has significant implications for how we as a country handle this epidemic, and what decisions we make going forward—and those decisions need to be made sooner, not later. On some level, this is a discussion of droplets versus aerosols. You’ve probably heard plenty this year about droplets: they’re larger in size and may be exhaled by someone talking, shouting, singing, coughing or sneezing. These droplets don’t travel far and fall quickly to the ground, one reason why a “social distance” of roughly six feet is seen as a safe one. If you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today. Aerosols, on the other hand, are tiny by comparison, nearly 10,000 times smaller than a human hair. They’re spread at far greater distances—20 to 30 feet—and can linger in the air for minutes to hours, infecting others. What constitutes a safe distance from aerosols is much harder to define, especially in crowded indoor spaces with poor ventilation. \\nChoosing a safe mask becomes difficult as well: an N95 respirator, for example, would be preferable to an ill-fitting cloth mask when it comes to filtering out these minuscule viral aerosols. For these and other reasons, some in the medical community suspect, our health agencies have been reluctant to accept the data on the airborne transmission of COVID-19—because if they do, they’re acknowledging a problem far more challenging even than what we’ve been dealt with so far. This reluctance has prompted an epic response. In a nearly unprecedented move, 239 scientists from 32 countries wrote an open letter to the WHO in July, urging the agency to recognize that airborne transmission of coronavirus by smaller aerosol particles is possible. The organization’s response was to subsequently update its position, stating that aerosol transmission “cannot be ruled out.” A glowing endorsement this was not—although, points out a spokesperson for the organization, “We have substantial guidance on the topic and speak repeatedly in press conferences and other venues about the importance of keeping indoor spaces well ventilated, precisely because of the potential of aerosol transmission in these settings. WHO has advice in the form of Q&As for the general public, and for people who manage public spaces and buildings and health facilities.” The CDC, meanwhile, posted on its Web site over the weekend that aerosolization may be “the main way the virus spreads,” then backtracked and removed the content from its site, claiming the language had been a draft of some proposed changes which were “posted in error.” This is a major point, not a minor one. Aerosol carry of the virus means that any indoor area where people gather in numbers—think restaurants, bars, churches, schools, rallies—is potentially a spreader of the disease, and depending upon the numbers, a superspreader. These are likely places with poor ventilation, where people not only are close together but may be speaking loudly, shouting, singing, cheering or booing, etc. \\nThe idea of aerosol spread is neither new nor controversial. Several diseases, including measles, chickenpox and tuberculosis, have been shown to be transmitted by aerosols. Patients sick with the flu have the virus in their exhaled breath, and that virus has been shown to be present in the air. This is true for some other viruses, including those found in infants. Scientists in Wuhan, China, have identified coronavirus RNA particles in the air in hospital areas, although they haven’t yet proven that the particles are infectious. Lab workers at the University of Nebraska have published their finding that they, too, have identified coronavirus RNA in the air. “We have pretty strong circumstantial evidence, in a number of these superspreading indoor incidents, that there must have been a significant component of aerosol or airborne transmission,” says William Bahnfleth, chair of the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) Epidemic Task Force. Bahnfleth noted several examples, including a restaurant in Guangzhou, China, where multiple people without direct contact with one another became infected from a single individual, and a choir practice in Washington state where presumed droplet and aerosol spread from singingsickened 53 people, two of whom died. In an e-mail interview, researcher Bjorn Birnir shared his work, published in a preprint (a non–peer reviewed paper), that demonstrated how an infected person continues to exhale a cloud of droplets and aerosols. These “build up over time to dangerous concentrations for everyone in the room,” Birnir says. While we don’t know exactly how much virus is needed to infect people or at what concentrations, these examples show that at some point the threshold is met and inhaled aerosols are the likely culprits. “Aerosol transmission plays a significant role in indoor environments and cannot be neglected,” says environmental science expert Maosheng Yao, a professor of engineering at Peking University. \"}],\n",
